      <h1>How to Watch the NHK Cup Live</h1>

      <p>
        After trying many methods, and requesting the help of my friend and
        fluent Japanese speaker Simão Gonçalves 4d EGF, I've finally found a
        simple and reproducible way of watching the NHK Cup over the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unexpectedly, watching the NHK Cup Live requires much less than I
        thought. At first, I tried to find a way of watching it on regular cable
        TV, but it seemed very impractical overall. Simão then pointed me to the
        NHK+ online streaming service, which was a good hint, but, as per the
        paradoxical Japanese way of being 19th century bureaucratic while having
        some of the best tech in the world, they require you to have a mailing
        address in Japan, through which they are going to check your
        application, via paperwork. Wtf indeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, I accidentally stumbled upon
        <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/tx7b0b/comment/i4ikm9k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3"
          >this comment</a
        >
        on Reddit. And, to my surprise, it was as easy as it gets to watch
        public Japanese TV. The software I recommend so far is

          ><strong>YoiTV</strong></a
        >
        &mdash; available for Windows, Mac, and Android, at least &mdash; for
        which you will need key codes you can find in
        <a href="https://livejapanesetv.wordpress.com/yoitv-free-key-codes/"
          >this post</a
        >
        &mdash; or, if the original author ends up deleting it,

          >I've saved it on the Wayback Machine</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NHK Cup's typical schedule is streaming one game per week on
        sundays, 12h30 to 14h, Japan time, of course. The channel is 2 or NHK E
        (Eテレ).
      </p>

      <p>
        Ever since I was able to watch it, I've also been recording the games. I
        would like to share them on YouTube, but I'm afraid I would be quickly
        shut down, as some other NHK Cup archive channels have been in the not
        so distant past. At any rate, I think I'm going to share at least one
        match, at most I'm gonna get only one strike. In parallel, I've created
        an
        <a href="https://odysee.com/@GoBadukWeiqiArchive:c"
          >archive channel on Odyssey</a
        >, where I believe I'm going to have some more leeway to share this type
        of content &mdash; Simão is helping me with the Japanese kanji of the
        players. Right before the streaming of the game, the NHK channel is
        having a 30 min program with Go miscellanea, I'm also going to try to
        record and archive it.

      <p>So, to recap, all you have to do is:</p>

        <li>

          Then unlock it with the keycodes:

          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Finally, go to channel 2 or NHK E (Eテレ) on Sundays between 12h30 to
          14h. Here is

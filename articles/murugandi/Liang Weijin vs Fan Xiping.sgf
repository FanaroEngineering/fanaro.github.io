> I, Philippe Fanaro (~1-2 KGS), have first reviewed this game personally and then used Leela Zero Big (ELO 16190 at 2k Variations) to rereview it. I'm far from a professional player, so take my commentary with a &mdash; huge &mdash; grain of salt. I've also used [Murugandi's review of Fan Xiping vs Shi Xiangxia\][murugandi_video\] on his channel as an additional, indirect resource for this review.

> It should also be noted that having White start and no komi for *Black* really does distort Leela's plays, specially at near the end of the game.

> I've used the Sabaki editor to review this game, so you might see less metadata if you choose another editor.

This is one of the games of the *Games of Wonder* book, by Jun Wu and Jiong Wu. This game is also known as *nailing down the [guoshou\][guoshou\] title* &mdash; Black 162 is seen as a nail, hence the pun &mdash;, because that's how Fan Xiping earned his. *Guoshou* means national hand or treasure. Fan Xiping became *guoshou* at the age of 16. Shi Xiangxia is also known as Shi Ding'an.

---

These games are known for:

1. Crazy games with a lot of exchanges, groups and tenukis.
1. The rules are not modern Chinese nor Japanese, but Ancient Chinese.
    1. Each group has a 2-point penalty to it &mdash; actually it's more accurate to say: *if one player had more living groups than the other, then every additional group costs 1 stone (2 points)*.
        - A group must have 2 eyes to live.
        - This incentivizes sacrificing and cutting groups.
    1. Cross hoshis start.
        - It somewhat compensates for the advantage of having to play first.
    1. White starts.
1. From a Jubango &mdash; Best of 10 &mdash; they played.
1. Ogeima and wide cross pincers were very common in the fuseki.

There is commentary of this game by the late legendary Chen Zude 9p: [Ancient Chinese Go Games with Detailed Commentary Series\][chen_zude_book\], but the whole book hasn't been translated to English yet apparently.

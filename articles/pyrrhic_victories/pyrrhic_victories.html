        <p>
          The trick play in question is triggered by the very strange, and
          arguable mistake, 2-space jump, seen in <em>Diagram 1</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Black's intention is to sacrifice the corner, but make it difficult
          enough to get an extremely solid wall on the outside.
          <em>Diagram 2</em> shows the continuation, in which Black lets himself
          get enclosed but White's shape starts show its defects.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img

            <em>Diagram 2</em>: White's cracks begin to show.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          According to Leela, the situation is still good for White, but a lot
          of care is needed. If you follow through with the "obvious moves",
          you're falling for the trap, as seen in <em>Diagram 3</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img

          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 3</em>: Black uses its inner group as buffer, to get
            forcing moves on the outside.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Some more forcing moves and Black is able to net White's group
          <em>in sente</em>, as in <em>Diagram 4</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/4. Black Successfully Triggers the Capturing Race.png"
            alt="Black Successfully Triggers the Capturing Race"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 4</em>: Some more forcing moves and the net is finally
            cast.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <em>Diagram 5</em>'s picture should be burnt into any SDK's mind as
          the canonical example of why thickness can be worth way more than a
          big corner. White's territory amounts to approximately 19 points,
          which is why this sequence is called the
          <em>Nineteen-Point Trick Play</em>. And Black's wall is sometimes
          called the <em>Iron Wall</em>. It's also worth mentioning that Black
          ends with sente, so developing from the wall will be easy.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/5. White Captures the Corner and Black Gets the Iron Wall.png"
            alt="White Captures the Corner and Black Gets the Iron Wall"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 5</em>: White finishes the corner, and hopefully
            realizes something is off: Black has created the
            <em>Iron Wall</em> for measlies 19 points.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          One alternative to White 5 in <em>Diagram 3</em> would have been to
          hane on the outside, shown in <em>Diagram 6</em>. White still gets the
          corner, but will be forced to crawl on the second line.If Black ends
          up with too little territory in the middle, or around <code>A</code>,
          this might be feasible, otherwise it might be even worse than the
          normal sequence.
        </p>

          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 6</em>: White goes for the outside hane, only to maybe
            have its situation worsen.

        </figure>

        <custom-h3 text="Pros and Doseki's Recommendations"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          The main way of avoiding the problems of the main trick sequence is to
          avoid it right from the start. For example, the main problem in
          White's shape is the cut at <code>8</code> in <em>Diagram 2</em>, so
          why not fix it preemptively? In this case, fixing it even has the
          benefit of damaging Black's pincer stone. This rationel is most pros'
          recommendation, and is shown in <em>Diagram 7</em> below.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Pros Recommendation 1.png"
            alt="Pros Recommendation 1"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 7</em>: The preemptive dog's shape is a great proper
            move against the trick play. Black is flattened at the top, and
            White damages the pincer.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Another way of refuting the trick is seen in <em>Diagram 8</em>.</p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Pros Recommendation 2.png"
            alt="Pros Recommendation 2"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 8</em>: White's shape is weaker than in
            <em>Diagram 7</em>, but the potential for profit is bigger.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          A final bookish alternative is from, allegedly,
          <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?topic=1097"
            >one of Inoue Doseki's (1582 - 1630) games</a
          >, one of the most legendary Go players of all time. In
          <em>Diagram 9</em>, White attacks the pincer stone in order to obtain
          enough forcing moves to come back to the trick play much stronger.
          Black can't fall for this trap and chooses to damage White even
          further at the top. The overall sequence seems to show a lot of
          <em>kiai</em> from both players.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="img/Doseki.png" alt="Doseki" />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 9</em>: Each player resists the temptation of following
            each other's plans.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <custom-h3 text="Leela's Alternatives"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          As usual, Leela doesn't seem to get fazed by puny human tricks. In
          fact, sometimes simple answer to the tricks work unexpectedly well.
          This case is no different, <em>Diagram 10</em> demonstrates an
          incredibly simple sequence to refute the trick: White is very thick,
          and will be able to counter-attack the pincer stone very nicely. A
          complete follow up after <code>5</code> is beyond the scope of this
          article, but, overall, White will be able to lean at Black's top group
          in order to gather strength and counter-attack if Black's pincer stone
          starts jumping out.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Leela's Alternative 1.png"
            alt="Leela's Alternative 1"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 10</em>: Leela's deceptively simple, first alternative.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          If you do end up getting cut, there are other, more optimal ways of
          resisting for White than the trick play sequence. Move
          <code>1</code> in <em>Diagram 3</em> is actually quite weird to me,
          for instance, it seems to end up helping Black's stones get stronger,
          which is almost never a good choice. A move like <code>1</code> in
          <em>Diagram 11</em> makes much more sense and is one Leela prefers.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Leela's Alternative 2.png"
            alt="Leela's Alternative 2"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 11</em>: White first stabilizes the group on the right
            in a more isolated fashion. Black will get a bigger corner, but the
            aji turns itself into a flower ko for White later on.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Another alternative to what's played in the trick sequence is simply
          crawling at the top. This might seem bad, but it isn't because White
          will damage Black's top stone while getting very solid shape. In
          <em>Diagram 12</em>, White stabilizes the top, damages Black's stones,
          and White's stones to the right aren't even captured yet.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Leela's Alternative 3.1.png"
            alt="Leela's Alternative 3.1."
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 12</em>: White stabilizes its position at the top while
            leaving options open at the left side. There's no clear way for
            Black to capture White's stones to the left.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <em>Diagram 13</em> shows how to "save" White's stones on the left,
          and is also what Leela considers the immediate best move. Even after
          Black has played so many moves in the area, trying to trick White left
          and right, White manages to live, and Black's wal is all for naught.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Leela's Alternative 3.2.png"
            alt="Leela's Alternative 3.2."
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 13</em>: White lives on the left, and Black is left with
            a mostly useless wall. If Black ataris at <code>A</code>, White will
            first capture and then either live, leaving weaknesses on Black's
            shape, or go through Black's "wall" with <code>B</code>. For more
            details, please do check out the
            <a href="pyrrhic_victories.sgf">SGF</a>.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          A final variation I would like to show is how Leela would handle the
          tricky move of <code>B15</code> instead of <code>7</code> in
          <em>Diagram 3</em>. <em>Diagram 14</em> shows that White is able to
          get out to the middle, however Black's shape to the left is thick and
          has better eye shape than in the traditional trick variation. In my
          opinion, though, this is much better resistance than the trick
          variation, which is kind of counter-intuitive because
          <code>B16</code> seems much more solid. At any rate, if you're the
          type of player who likes complications, this might be a good way of
          tossing the ball back on Black's side, because it surely isn't easy to
          cleanly read all the variations for Black.

          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 14</em>: the overall result is similar to the main trick
            sequence, but the sequence is much harder to read.

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Pyrrhic Victories"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          <em>Pyrrhic victories</em> are named after Pyrrhus of Epirus, king and
          general who thought the Romans on behalf of the Greeks. During the
          Pyrrhic War, around 280 B.C., he suffered irreplaceable losses at the
          battles of Heraclea and Asculum.
        </p>

        <p>
          In both victories, the Romans suffered more losses than the Greeks,
          however, their pool of replacements was far greater, and Pyrrhus could
          not afford such overarching losses. After those victories, Pyrrhus is
          reported, by Plutarch, to have said:
        </p>

        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          If we are victorius in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be
          utterly ruined.
        </p>

        <p>How is this related to Go? How is this related to josekis?</p>

        <p>
          To me, this resembles a lot the trick play discussed in the previous
          section. White is tricked into overinvesting to achieve local victory,
          even though it might cost exponentially more globally.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pyrrhus of Epirus was said to have been quite the brash general, too
          hasty, which might also remind us of our usual first intincts to
          punish our opponent's abusive plays. Let's have him be a cautionary
          tale of what this type of behavior might generate in the end, in the
          grand scheme of things.

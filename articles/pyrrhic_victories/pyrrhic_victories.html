        <p>
          <em>Pyrrhic victories</em> are named after Pyrrhus of Epirus, king and
          general who thought the Romans on behalf of the Greeks. During the
          Pyrrhic War, around 280 B.C., he suffered irreplaceable losses at the
          battles of Heraclea and Asculum.
        </p>

        <p>
          In both victories, the Romans suffered more losses than the Greeks,
          however, their pool of replacements was far greater, and Pyrrhus could
          not afford such overarching losses. After those victories, Pyrrhus is
          reported, by Plutarch, to have said:
        </p>

        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          If we are victorius in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be
          utterly ruined.
        </p>

        <p>How is this related to Go? How is this related to josekis?</p>

        <p>
          To me, this resembles a lot the trick play discussed in the previous
          section. White is tricked into overinvesting to achieve local victory,
          even though it might cost exponentially more globally.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pyrrhus of Epirus was said to have been quite the brash general, too
          hasty, which might also remind us of our usual first intincts to
          punish our opponent's abusive plays. Let's have him be a cautionary
          tale of what this type of behavior might generate in the end, in the
          grand scheme of things.

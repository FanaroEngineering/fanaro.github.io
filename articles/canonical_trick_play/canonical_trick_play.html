        <!-- TODO: Zip all the SGFs into a link below when everything has been
                   properly edited. -->
        You can download all of the SGFs used in this post <a href="">here</a>.
        I use <a href="https://sabaki.yichuanshen.de/">Sabaki</a> as my editor,
        which features some extra bling on the game tree. So, in order to
        extract the most from my SGFs, I advise you to use it too. Don't forget
        to donate to the project too!

        The closest I got to finding a successful professional use of this trick
        play is a game between Kang Dongyun and Lee Jaeung, back in 2007, when
        they were both 5p. Kang Dongyun 9p uses this pattern to both enclose the
        corner and switch to developing the left side, something which wouldn't
        have been possible with the standard joseki in this case.
      </p>

      <div
        data-wgo="Kang Dongyun - Lee Jaeung.sgf"
        data-wgo-board="stoneHandler: WGo.Board.drawHandlers.NORMAL,
                        background: '../../assets/wgo/textures/wood2.jpg'"
        class="SGF"

        Apparently, one of the pros, namely Tono Hiroaki 9p, in 1991, fell for
        the trap and got a smaller territory than he should. His opponent was
        Cho Chikun 9p, and this sequence was likely a favorite of his, because
        he played it at least 3 times:

        Another worthwhile game to mention is

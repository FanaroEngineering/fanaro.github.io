          This wasn't supposed to be that long. I wanted it to be a simple post
          with a short English version of a tiny video a I was going to post in
          Portuguese for
          <local-link

          >. However, before creating the short post I decided to ask Reddit (<a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/"
            >r/baduk</a
          >) if anyone had anything to say about the this typical
          trick-punishment pattern (see <em>Diagram 2</em>). It turns out
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Uberdude85/">Uberdude85</a> knew
          of something quite substantial that I didn't:
          <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/iz5388/does_anyone_have_a_link_to_an_article_of_a_pro/"
            >the typical punishment is suboptimal/wrong</a
          >. His rebuttal has been corroborated by a fair number of pros and
          strong amateurs recently as well.

          In the next section, I'll expose the digested version of all the
          sequences, but all of them are in
          <a href="canonical_trick_play.sgf">the SGF accompanying this post</a>.
          You can also dive deep into the rabbit hole, if you wish, by going
          through all of the collected references in the last section.

        <p>
          Interestingly enough, some pros have played this move, and the games
          are searchable through
          <a href="http://ps.waltheri.net/">Waltheri's Go Pattern Search</a>.
          Nevertheless, more surprisingly, even Shusaku has faced this pattern
          in one of his games; and, even more astonishing, is that he seems to
          subscribe to the supposedly more correct punishment.

        <custom-h3 text="The Overview of The Position"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          The trick play in question comes from one of the first josekis most
          people learn, shown in <em>Diagram 1</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>

          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 1</em>: One of the most basic josekis.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Interestingly enough, what I'm calling a trick play is actually called
          a mistake by most &mdash; slightly more experienced &mdash; players,
          the hane at <code>A</code>, in <em>Diagram 2</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="img/The Trick Play.png" alt="The Trick Play" />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 2</em>: the trick play, or, maybe a simple mistake?
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          There are many options on how to react for White, mostly ranging from
          <code>B</code> to <code>E</code>; tenuking is usually not one of them,
          since taking the corner or having the either <code>B</code> or
          <code>E</code> is quite big.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>B</code> would evolve into a typical 3-3 invasion, as seen in
          <em>Diagram 3</em>. This would clearly be inferior to the joseki shown
          previously, in <em>Diagram 1</em> &mdash; it's worth mentioning that
          this type of loss is not the end of the world, most mistakes are
          actually made during the middle game anyway<foot-note
            text="Bear with me... I know this joseki could be played during the
            middle game too..."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <!-- TODO: B to 3-3 Invasion -->
          <img src="" alt="3-3 Invasion" />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 3</em>: the trick play ends up working: the joseki
            evolves into a 3-3 invasion.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <code>E</code> seems to be not so unlikely due to White's stone on the
          left, but Black's shape after <code>C</code> is very good. White will
          probably crawl on the second line in order to live, as in
          <em>Diagram 4</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <!-- TODO: E to crawling on the second line -->
          <img src="" alt="E into White crawling on the second line" />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 4</em>: Black's hane at <code>C</code> is just too good
            a shape. White ends up crawling on the second line.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          All that's left for White now is, then, to either <code>C</code> or
          <code>D</code>, in <em>Diagram 2</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>C</code> is what basically everyone learns as a DDK or high SDK,
          despite it being quite the weird shape. It does work, but the question
          is: is it the best White can do? Or: is this all even a trick-punish
          ordeal or a (more or less) new joseki? Those are assessments
          <em>you</em> will have to decide for yourself, but I do believe most
          "reasonable" sequences are way more even than most players want to
          acknowledge.
        </p>

        <p>Let's dive a bit deeper on <code>C</code> first.</p>

        <custom-h3 text="Hopefully Debunking the Descent"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          The reason <code>C</code> has become such a staple of a trick play is
          that then <code>E</code> in <em>Diagram 2</em> becomes fairly easy to
          do, and White successfully captures a big corner, as seen in
          <em>Diagram 5</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - Falling for the Trick 1.png"
            alt="Descent - Falling for the Trick 1"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 5</em>: Black's 3 stones are in bad shape, it's
            difficult to save the <code>1</code> stone.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          There are many ways of showing that Black's situation becomes quite
          hopeless after <code>Q18</code>, and I'm not going to show all of
          them, but <em>Diagram 6</em> and <em>Diagram 7</em> should illustrate
          two other important ways of finishing the position for White.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - Falling for the Trick 2.png"
            alt="Descent - Falling for the Trick 2"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 6</em>: Black can try harder, but it will only make
            White's corner larger.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - Falling for the Trick 3.png"
            alt="Descent - Falling for the Trick 3"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 7</em>: That's what happens when you're too clever and
            the other player has more tesujis and patterns under his/her belt.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The thing is... the descent as a play has induced a generation of
          players to fall for two mistakes making a right, in my opinion. The
          cut doesn't seem to work, and the descent looks even weirder. But,
          when Black realizes its cut was a mistake, the sequence comes back
          into something more grounded in reality. A simple connection puts
          Black in a position where it has quite the thick wall, as seen in
          <em>Diagram 8</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - The Typical Punishment.png"
            alt="Descent - Black develops a wall"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 8</em>: A wall like this is nothing to be scoffed at.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          This wall is very thick, it's even thicker than most enclosure
          josekis. Even though <code>A</code> doesn't fully connect to the stone
          on the left, it's not as if other enclosure josekis didn't have their
          problems either. The banal enclosure joseki at the bottom of
          <em>Diagram 9</em> features glaring weaknesses around
          <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, for instance. In the new pattern,
          even if Black doesn't fully enclose &mdash; which is seen in the next
          section, in a pro game, by the way &mdash;, Black still has
          <code>D</code> available, to form a base for the stone at the top.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/A Comparison Between Enclosures.png"
            alt="A Comparison Between Enclosures"
            height="550px"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 9</em>: A comparison between 2 corner enclosure
            "josekis".
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Another Black could enclose White, seen in <em>Diagram 10</em>, is
          what most other players have suggested as the main sequence for
          disproving the descent as the punishment to the trick play.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - The Best White can do still leaves Black Thick.png"
            alt="The Best White can do still leaves Black Thick"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 10</em>: Black fully encloses White this time, albeit
            with a ladder. Black could also choose to fight by playing
            <code>A</code>. White's territory is very small compared to Black's
            thickness.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          However, I think the cleanest example to debunk the descent is
          actually <em>Diagram 11</em>,
          <a
            href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?44PointOneSpaceLowPincerInvasionInterception"
            >which is also what's shown on Sensei's Library</a
          >. Black gets a very thick and clean shape from the tiger's mouth.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - Black Gets Thick.png"
            alt="Black Gets Thick"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 11</em>: Black's stone on the left is still not fully
            connected, but the overall shape is incredible for Black.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Now, I hope we can move on to move <code>D</code>, the hane, from
          <em>Diagram 2</em>.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="The Hane"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          The most important sequence which differentiates the descent from the
          hane is the final shape after Black's connection. It should be clear
          to most dan players that the shape in <em>Diagram 12</em> is much
          stronger than White connecting at <code>C</code> &mdash; I'm sorry to
          weaker players, but this is a discussion you'll have elsewhere.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Proper Hane - White Gets Thicker Shape.png"
            alt="White Gets Thicker Shape"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 12</em>: White's shape is much more solid and thicker,
            which will allow more ways of exploiting Black's weaknesses in the
            future.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Black can try to resist, but the end result won't look nice, as seen
          in <em>Diagram 13</em>, the <code>A</code> stone is severely damaged,
          Black has poor shape and hasn't even captured the White stones to the
          right.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Proper Hane - White Damages while Penetrating Black.png"
            alt="White Gets Thicker Shape"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 13</em>: Black's stubborness will get him almost killed.
            I'll let you decide if you'd rather have Black stones be killed
            instead.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          In terms of resistance, the best Black can hope for is using his
          stones to force White's enclosure &mdash; which is seen in 2 pro games
          in the next section &mdash;, as in <em>Diagram 14</em>. Black can and
          should probably fix its wall with a tiger's mouth, to protect
          <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> at the same time, and White will
          have sente to diminish the effect of the wall. White's corner is
          bigger than usual, and so is Black's thickness; the final result is
          much more even than expected in my opinion, even though the wall is in
          an unexpected direction, given the initial position.
        </p>

        <!-- TODO: This is not ok. This diagram is not consistent with the rest
                   of the argument. -->

        <blockquote>
          This weird direction of play from Black isn't really all that weird
          after witnessing some recent AI josekis, though, is it?
        </blockquote>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Proper Hane - White is Enclosed from.png"
            alt="White is Enclosed"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 14</em>: Black encloses White with astounding thickness;
            White has a big corner and sente; Black's wall is in a weird
            direction, given the initial position.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Black could offer a lot of resistance if there's a little bit of
          reinforcement in the area. <em>Diagrams 15</em> shows how a single
          stone can change the outcome completely.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Proper Hane - No Punishment if Black Stones on the Side.png"
            alt="No Punishment if Black Stones on the Side"

          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 15</em>: At the right place, at the right time.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          If Black has a stone to the side, as in <em>Diagram 15</em>, it is
          wiser to revert back to a 3-3 invasion, like <em>Diagram 16</em>. In
          fact, it's likely the optimal choice, since it makes Black's original
          stone on the side way less efficient than desired. Curiously, this is
          what Tono Hiroaki 9p played against Cho Chikun 9p in 1991, mentioned
          in the next section.
        </p>

        <p>
          The discussion on the hane actually doesn't end optimally with
          <em>Diagram 14</em>. Most references point the hane plus clamp as the
          most likely optimal play for both sides, as in <em>Diagram 17</em>.
          <code>A</code> for <code>B</code> is <em>aji-keshi</em>, a bad
          exchange for Black. Pros seem to think this is enough of a punishment,
          but I'll let you decide: isn't this discussion the epitome of the road
          being more important than the destination: all this to end up with a
          "minimal" <em>aji-keshi</em> solution?!

        <blockquote>
          This is a cut I'm analyzing on my own, using Leela as a crutch and
          confirmation tool. I think the overall results make sense, but, as
          always, I'm open to feedback.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          One final variation that bugged me out quite a bit is the cut after a
          kosumi in the descent variations, which is shown below, in
          <em>Diagram 18</em>.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Black could have reverted the course to more normal variations by
          plaing <code>14</code> at <code>15</code>, but, after White
          <code>13</code>, Leela also sees Black <code>14</code> as the only
          option.
        </p>

        <p>
          Black is still worse here. My first intuition was to give Black the
          corner while squashing from the outside, and that's exactly what Leela
          thought as optimal, which is shown in <em>Diagram 19</em>.

          The closest I got to finding a successful professional use of this
          trick play is a game between Kang Dongyun and Lee Jaeung, back in
          2007, when they were both 5p. Kang Dongyun 9p uses this pattern to
          both enclose the corner and switch to developing the left side,
          something which wouldn't have been possible with the standard joseki
          in this case.

          Apparently, one of the pros, namely Tono Hiroaki 9p, in 1991, fell for
          the trap and got a smaller territory than he should. Or did he?
          White's stone on the side makes the 3-3 invasion more efficient than
          expected, as discussed in the previous section. His opponent was Cho
          Chikun 9p, and this "trick play" was likely a favorite of his, because
          he played it at least 3 times:

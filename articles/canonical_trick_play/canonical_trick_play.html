          This wasn't supposed to be that long. I wanted it to be a simple post
          with a short English version of a tiny video a I was going to post in
          Portuguese for
          <local-link
            text="my YouTube channel"
            link="https://youtube.com/c/PhilippeFanaro"
          ></local-link
          >. However, before creating the short post I decided to ask Reddit (<a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/"
            >r/baduk</a
          >) if anyone had anything to say about the this typical
          trick-punishment pattern (see <em>Diagram 2</em>). It turns out
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Uberdude85/">Uberdude85</a> knew
          of something quite substantial that I didn't:
          <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/iz5388/does_anyone_have_a_link_to_an_article_of_a_pro/"
            >the typical punishment is suboptimal/wrong</a
          >. His rebuttal has been corroborated by a fair number of pros and
          strong amateurs recently as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the next section, I'll expose the digested version of all the
          sequences, but all of them are in
          <a href="canonical_trick_play.sgf">the SGF accompanying this post</a>.
          You can also dive deep into the rabbit hole, if you wish, by going
          through all of the collected references in the last section.

        <p>
          I do appreciate feedback even though there's no comment section on my
          website. All you need to do is either message me on one of the
          plethora of social networks I'm a part of, or simply offer a comment
          or contribution on

        <p>
          The trick play in question comes from one of the first josekis most
          people learn, shown in <em>Diagram 1</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="img/Usual Joseki.png" alt="Usual Joseki" />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 1</em>: One of the most basic josekis.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Interestingly enough, what I'm calling a trick play is actually called
          a mistake by most &mdash; slightly more experienced &mdash; players,
          the hane at <code>A</code>, in <em>Diagram 2</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="img/The Trick Play.png" alt="The Trick Play" />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 2</em>: the trick play, or, maybe a simple mistake?
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          There are many options on how to react for White, mostly ranging from
          <code>B</code> to <code>E</code>; tenuking is usually not one of them,
          since taking the corner or having the either <code>B</code> or
          <code>E</code> is quite big.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>B</code> would evolve into a typical 3-3 invasion, as seen in
          <em>Diagram 3</em>. This would clearly be inferior to the joseki shown
          previously, in <em>Diagram 1</em> &mdash; it's worth mentioning that
          this type of loss is not the end of the world, most mistakes are
          actually made during the middle game anyway<foot-note
            text="Bear with me... I know this joseki could be played during the
            middle game too..."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <!-- TODO: B to 3-3 Invasion -->
          <img src="" alt="3-3 Invasion" />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 3</em>: the trick play ends up working: the joseki
            evolves into a 3-3 invasion.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <code>E</code> seems to be not so unlikely due to White's stone on the
          left, but Black's shape after <code>C</code> is very good. White will
          probably crawl on the second line in order to live, as in
          <em>Diagram 4</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <!-- TODO: E to crawling on the second line -->
          <img src="" alt="E into White crawling on the second line" />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 4</em>: Black's hane at <code>C</code> is just too good
            a shape. White ends up crawling on the second line.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          All that's left for White now is, then, to either <code>C</code> or
          <code>D</code>, in <em>Diagram 2</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>C</code> is what basically everyone learns as a DDK or high SDK,
          despite it being quite the weird shape. It does work, but the question
          is: is it the best White can do? Or: is this all even a trick-punish
          ordeal or a (more or less) new joseki?

          The closest I got to finding a successful professional use of this
          trick play is a game between Kang Dongyun and Lee Jaeung, back in
          2007, when they were both 5p. Kang Dongyun 9p uses this pattern to
          both enclose the corner and switch to developing the left side,
          something which wouldn't have been possible with the standard joseki
          in this case.
        </p>

        <div
          data-wgo="Kang Dongyun - Lee Jaeung.sgf"
          data-wgo-board="stoneHandler: WGo.Board.drawHandlers.NORMAL,
                        background: '../../assets/wgo/textures/wood2.jpg'"
          class="SGF"

        </div>

        <p>
          Apparently, one of the pros, namely Tono Hiroaki 9p, in 1991, fell for
          the trap and got a smaller territory than he should. His opponent was
          Cho Chikun 9p, and this sequence was likely a favorite of his, because
          he played it at least 3 times:
        </p>

        <div
          data-wgo="Tono Hiroaki - Cho Chikun.sgf"
          data-wgo-board="stoneHandler: WGo.Board.drawHandlers.NORMAL,

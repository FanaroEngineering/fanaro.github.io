          This wasn't supposed to be this long. I wanted it to be a simple post,
          a short English version of a tiny video I was going to post in
          Portuguese for

            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/"
            >r/baduk</a
          >) if anyone had anything to say about this typical trick-punishment
          pattern &mdash; see <em>Diagram 2</em> below. It turns out
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Uberdude85/">Uberdude85</a> knew
          of something quite substantial I didn't:

              &quot;punishing&quot; a play is the right wording, the right

          In the next section, I'll expose the digested version of all the

          Interestingly enough, some pros have played this move, and the games
          are searchable through
          <a href="http://ps.waltheri.net/">Waltheri's Go Pattern Search</a>.
          Nevertheless, more surprisingly, even Shusaku has faced this pattern
          in one of his games; and, even more astonishing, is that he seems to
          have subscribed to the supposedly more correct punishment.

        <custom-h3 text="The Overview of The Position"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          The trick play in question comes from one of the first josekis most
          people learn, shown in <em>Diagram 1</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="img/Usual Joseki.png" alt="Usual Joseki" />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 1</em>: One of the most basic josekis.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Interestingly enough, what I'm calling a trick play is actually also
          called a mistake<foot-note
            text="Or maybe it's not so surprising, as most trick plays are
            called mistakes, by many experienced amateurs, and pros."
          ></foot-note>
          by most &mdash; slightly more experienced &mdash; players, the hane at
          <code>A</code>, in <em>Diagram 2</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="img/The Trick Play.png" alt="The Trick Play" />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 2</em>: the trick play, or maybe a simple mistake?
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          There are many options on how to react for White, mostly ranging from
          <code>B</code> to <code>E</code>; tenuking is usually not one of them,
          since taking the corner or having the either <code>B</code> or
          <code>E</code> is quite big.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>B</code> would evolve into a typical 3-3 invasion, as seen in
          <em>Diagram 3</em>. This would clearly be inferior to the joseki shown
          previously, in <em>Diagram 1</em> &mdash; it's worth mentioning that
          this type of loss is not the end of the world, most mistakes are
          actually made during the middle game anyway<foot-note
            text="Bear with me... I know this joseki could be played during the
            middle game too..."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Black succeeds and the Trick Play becomes a 3-3 invasion.png"
            alt="3-3 Invasion"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 3</em>: the trick play ends up working: the joseki
            (d)evolves into a 3-3 invasion.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <code>E</code> seems to be not so unlikely, due to White's stone on
          the left, but Black's shape after <code>C</code> in
          <em>Diagram 3</em> is very good. White will probably crawl on the
          second line in order to live, as in <em>Diagram 4</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/White Cuts at E and Black gets a Comfortable Hane at C.png"
            alt="E into White crawling on the second line"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 4</em>: Black's hane at <code>C</code> (in
            <em>Diagram 2</em>) is just too good a shape. White ends up crawling
            on the second line.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          To my surprise, when evaluating the variation in
          <em>Diagram 4</em> with Leela<foot-note
            text="I'm using Leela Zero's weights from the beginning of 2021."
          ></foot-note
          >, it still thinks White maintains its initial, usual lead, perhaps
          proving once again that these mistakes are not so bad, after all.
        </p>

        <p>
          All that's left for White now is, then, to either <code>C</code> or
          <code>D</code>, in <em>Diagram 2</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>C</code> is what basically everyone learns as a DDK or high SDK,
          despite it being quite the weird shape. It does work, but the question
          remains: is it really the best White can do? Or: is this all even a
          trick-punish ordeal or a (more or less) new joseki? Those are
          assessments <em>you</em> will have to decide for yourself, but I do
          believe most "reasonable" sequences are way more even than most
          players want to acknowledge.
        </p>

        <p>Let's dive a bit deeper into <code>C</code> first.</p>

        <custom-h3 text="Hopefully Debunking the Descent"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          The reason <code>C</code> has become such a staple of a trick play is
          that <code>E</code> in <em>Diagram 2</em> then becomes fairly easy to
          do, and White successfully captures a big corner, as seen in
          <em>Diagram 5</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - Falling for the Trick 1.png"
            alt="Descent - Falling for the Trick 1"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 5</em>: Black's 3 stones are in bad shape, it's
            difficult to save the stone <code>1</code>.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          There are many ways of showing that Black's situation becomes quite
          hopeless after <code>Q18</code> in <em>Diagram 5</em>, and I'm not
          going to show all of them, but <em>Diagram 6</em> and
          <em>Diagram 7</em> should be able to illustrate two other important
          ways of finishing the position for White.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - Falling for the Trick 2.png"
            alt="Descent - Falling for the Trick 2"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 6</em>: Black can try harder, but it will only make
            White's corner larger.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - Falling for the Trick 3.png"
            alt="Descent - Falling for the Trick 3"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 7</em>: That's what happens when you think you're too
            clever, and the other player possesses more tesujis and patterns
            under his/her belt.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The thing is... the descent as a play has induced a generation of
          players to fall for two mistakes making a right, in my opinion. The
          cut at <code>E</code> in <em>Diagram 2</em> doesn't seem to work, but
          the descent looks even weirder. However, when Black realizes its cut
          was a mistake, the sequence comes back into something more grounded in
          reality. A simple connection puts Black in a position where it has
          quite the thick wall, as seen in <em>Diagram 8</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - The Typical Punishment.png"
            alt="Descent - Black develops a wall"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 8</em>: A wall like this is nothing to be scoffed at.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          This wall is very thick, it's even thicker than most enclosure
          josekis. Even though <code>A</code> doesn't fully connect to the stone
          on the left, it's not as if other enclosure josekis didn't have their
          fair share of problems either. The banal enclosure joseki at the
          bottom of <em>Diagram 9</em> features glaring weaknesses around
          <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, for instance. In the new pattern,
          even if Black doesn't fully enclose &mdash; which is seen in the next
          section, in a pro game, by the way &mdash;, Black still has
          <code>D</code> available, to form a base for the stone at the top.
        </p>

        <p>
          Leela actually rates the situations in <em>Diagram 8</em> and
          <em>Diagram 10</em> as very slightly better for Black, in fact.
          Considering the descent was supposed to be a punishment, I would say
          White has failed.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/A Comparison between Enclosures.png"
            alt="A Comparison Between Enclosures"
            height="650px"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 9</em>: A comparison between 2 corner enclosure
            "josekis".
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Another way through which Black could enclose White, seen in
          <em>Diagram 10</em>, is what most other players have suggested as the
          main sequence for disproving the descent as the punishment to the
          trick play.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - The Best White can do still leaves Black Thick.png"
            alt="The Best White can do still leaves Black Thick"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 10</em>: Black fully encloses White this time, albeit
            with a ladder. Black could also choose to fight by playing
            <code>A</code>. White's territory is very small compared to Black's
            thickness.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          However, I think the cleanest example to debunk the descent is
          actually <em>Diagram 11</em>,
          <a
            href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?44PointOneSpaceLowPincerInvasionInterception"
            >which is also what's shown on Sensei's Library</a
          >, and is <em>exactly what Leela suggests</em>. Black gets a very
          thick and clean shape from the tiger's mouth.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Descent - Black Gets Thick.png"
            alt="Black Gets Thick"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 11</em>: Black's stone on the left is still not fully
            connected, but the overall shape is incredible for Black.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          An extra variation, which is one of Leela's favorite sequences on this
          topic and also what's
          <a href="https://online-go.com/joseki/666"
            >shown on OGS's josekipedia</a
          >, is shown in <em>Diagram 12</em> below.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Proper Hane - Leela's Thick Enclosure.png"
            alt="White gets the corner, and Black gets very thick."
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 12</em>: White gets the corner, and Black gets very
            thick.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Now, I hope we can move on to move <code>D</code>, the hane, from
          <em>Diagram 2</em>.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="The Hane"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          The most important, at least initially, sequence which differentiates
          the descent from the hane is the final shape after Black's connection.
          It should be clear to most dan players that the shape in
          <em>Diagram 13</em> is much stronger than White connecting at
          <code>C</code> &mdash; I'm sorry to weaker players, but this is a
          discussion you'll have to seek elsewhere.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Proper Hane - White Gets Thicker Shape.png"
            alt="White Gets Thicker Shape"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 13</em>: White's shape is much more solid and thicker,
            which will allow more ways of exploiting Black's weaknesses in the
            future.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Black can try to resist, but the end result won't look nice, as seen
          in <em>Diagram 14</em>. The <code>A</code> stone in
          <em>Diagram 14</em> is severely damaged; Black has poor shape, and

            <em>Diagram 14</em>: Black's stubbornness will get him
            <em>almost</em> killed. I'll let you decide if you'd rather have
            Black stones committing suicide instead.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          In terms of resistance, the best Black can hope for is using his
          stones to force White's enclosure &mdash; which is seen in at least 2
          pro games, from Walther's Pattern Search &mdash;, as in
          <em>Diagram 15</em>. Black can and should probably fix its wall with a
          tiger's mouth, to protect both <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> at
          the same time; and White will have sente to diminish the effect of the
          wall.
        </p>

        <p>
          White's corner is considerably bigger now, Black will have to overcome
          a komi of 10+ points henceforth. It might not seem to make a huge
          difference to most, but, at least to my 1 dan brain, White's shape in
          <em>Diagram 15</em> is at least one order of magnitude better than in
          <em>Diagram 10</em>, whatever that means. Leela thinks in a similar
          fashion &mdash; even despite <em>Diagram 10</em> being under the whims
          of a ladder! &mdash;, <em>Diagram 10</em> is rated at around 50±5%,
          while <em>Diagram 15</em> hovers around 85% for White, which might
          finally fit the requirements for a trick play punishment.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          This weird direction of play from Black isn't really all that weird
          after having witnessed some of the recent AI josekis, though, is it?
        </blockquote>

          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 15</em>: Black encloses White with great thickness;

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Black could offer a lot of resistance if there's a little bit of
          reinforcement in the area. <em>Diagram 16</em> shows how a single
          stone can change the outcome completely.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          If Black has a stone to the side, as in <em>Diagram 16</em>, it is
          wiser to revert back to a 3-3 invasion, like <em>Diagram 17</em>. In
          fact, it's likely the optimal choice, since it makes Black's original
          stone on the side way less efficient than desired. Curiously, this is
          what Tono Hiroaki 9p played against Cho Chikun 9p in 1991, mentioned
          in the next section.
        </p>

          <img

          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 17</em>: Black's stone to the side makes the 3-3
            invasion surprisingly efficient.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The discussion on the hane actually doesn't end optimally with
          <em>Diagram 15</em>, at least not according to most of the pros who
          prefer the hane. Most references point the hane plus clamp as the most
          likely optimal play for both sides, as in <em>Diagram 18</em>.
          <code>A</code> for <code>B</code> is <em>aji-keshi</em>, a bad
          exchange for Black. Pros seem to think this is enough of a punishment,
          but I'll let you decide: isn't this discussion the epitome of the road
          being more important than the destination: such a long-winded
          discussion to end up with a "minimal" <em>aji-keshi</em> solution?!
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/Proper Hane - Optimal with Aji-Keshi.png"
            alt="Optimal Solution, Aji-Keshi"
          />
          <figcaption>
            <em>Diagram 18</em>: The <em>aji-keshi</em> exchange of
            <code>A</code> for <code>B</code> is supposedly good enough
            punishment.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Lastly, I would like to mention that Leela offers way more complicated
          solutions to this problem, most of which are way above my pay grade.
          In general, though it prefers something of the form seen in
          <em>Diagram 15</em>, without the forced enclosure sacrifice. As usual
          with AIs, there are many loose enclosures and tenukis.
        </p>

        <p>But before we move on with our lives...</p>

        <p>
          White's move <code>6</code> on <em>Diagram 18</em> could actually have
          been more severe. However, it only works badly for Black if White has
          the ladder, as shown on <em>Diagram 19</em> below.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          This is a cut I'm analyzing on my own, using Leela as a crutch and
          confirmation tool. I think the overall results make sense, but, as
          always, I'm open to feedback.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          One final variation that bugged me out quite a bit is the cut after a
          kosumi in the descent variations, which is shown below, in
          <em>Diagram 21</em>.
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Black could have reverted the course to more normal variations by
          playing, in <em>Diagram 21</em>, <code>3</code> at <code>4</code>,
          but, after White <code>2</code>, Leela also sees Black
          <code>3</code> as the only option.
        </p>

        <p>
          Black is still worse here, at least globally. My first intuition was
          to give Black the corner while squashing from the outside, and that's
          exactly what Leela thought as optimal, which is shown in
          <em>Diagram 22</em>.

          The closest I got to finding a successful professional use of this
          trick play is within a game between Kang Dongyun and Lee Jaeung, back
          in 2007, when they were both 5p. Lee Jaeung 7p, at move 24, uses
          this pattern to both enclose &mdash; sort of &mdash; the corner and
          switch to developing the left side, something which wouldn't have been
          possible with more standard josekis in this case, I don't think
          &mdash; anyway, it looks quite creative and scrappy.

          Apparently, one of the pros, namely Tono Hiroaki 9p, in 1991, fell for
          the trap and got a smaller territory than he should. Or did he?
          White's stone on the side makes the 3-3 invasion more efficient than
          expected, as discussed in the previous section. His opponent was Cho
          Chikun 9p, and this "trick play" was likely a favorite of his, because
          he played it at least 3 times:

            >blooper in Sensei's Library</a

          gets countered with the hane, and then sets up a ladder that doesn't
          work, the typical pro play, you know. A gigantic, doomed to fail,
          fight ensues and Cho Chikun 9p loses:

          The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence in which the next number is the
          sum of the two previous ones. The two base cases are \[F_0 = 0\] and
          \[F_1 = 1\], and the overall formula is:
        </p>

        <p>\[F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2}\]</p>

        <p>So, in the end, we would have a sequence like this:</p>

        <p>\[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,...\]</p>

        <p>
          More specifically, I've stumbled upon it when facing capturing races
          with "big eyes", with recaptures that remind you a lot of recursion,
          i.e., a clump of 5 stones becomes a clump 4, then a 3, and so forth.
          Usually, fully reading these capturing races is so difficult when also
          trying to juggle the whole board in your head that more experienced
          players simply say "just remember the 4-stone dead clump has 5
          liberties<foot-note text="Effective liberties."></foot-note>; and the
          5-stone clump has 8".
        </p>

        <p>
          Anything bigger than
          <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Nakade">Nakade</a> #5 will 95% of
          the time yield either life or seki. And clumps smaller than 4 are much
          easier to read, and actually have a linear relationship with the
          number of liberties. So, we are golden, right? Just know 2 shapes by
          heart and that's it, right? And they follow Fibonacci anyway so just
          memorize Fibonacci, right? But, wait, do they all really follow
          Fibonacci? Well, shut up and sit down, s'il vous plaît...
        </p>
        <p>
          I would say that knowing how to count these weird capture-recapture
          sequences is necessary if you want to get better at the game. And,
          perhaps, it will enlighten us with a better system than simply knowing
          2 of the most important instances by heart. Besides all that, you will
          have the extra benefit of being fully confident about what you're
          doing. At any rate, discussing things has a much higher retention rate
          than blunt memorization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studying the examples below would be much easier with supplemental
          material in the form of SGFs, which you can download
          <local-link link="fibonacci.zip" text="here"></local-link>. I've
          created those diagrams using
          <a href="https://sabaki.yichuanshen.de/">Sabaki</a>, so, if you wish
          to see all the mark-ups, you're going to inevitably have to use it.

        <p>
          With recursion, the easiest way to start &mdash; and something math
          teachers should prioritize &mdash; is in fact not by how to get to the
          base cases, but by only studying the base cases. Once you have them
          worked out to the bone, then go for how a more complicated use case
          evolves. So, in our instance of recursion, we start with the 1-stone
          clump. This one is simple: 1 liberty.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="1_stone_clump.PNG" />
          <figcaption>1-stone dead clump or Nakade #1.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          In the second base case, White has two options for following the
          throw-in. If she stays passive, Black captures in a total of two
          moves. If she captures the initial throw-in at <code>A</code> or
          <code>B</code>, Black will next be able to capture the whole thing,
          since it only has 1 liberty anyway &mdash; and is basically the
          previous, 1-stone base case actually. When White captures Black’s
          throw-in stone, nothing changes in terms of liberties, but it now
          becomes Black's turn instead of White's, meaning the capture
          constitutes a mistake because White effectively loses one liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up to now, these two base cases are very straightforward and don't
          really show recursion when played correctly.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="2_stone_clump_marked.PNG" />
          <figcaption>2-stone dead clump or Nakade #2.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          In the third use case, we have the first and, probably, most important
          of the dynamics. Black playing <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> can
          be followed up by a capture from White; however what's important to
          remember is that White's recapture doesn't count as a liberty, as it
          doesn't affect the status of anything else. It follows, then, that
          <code>B</code> and the subsequent black move in the race should count
          as only one liberty, because White has simply reset the position
          essentially, making Black simply repeat its efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Summarizing, Black plays 2 moves initially, White captures, Black
          plays 2 more moves. But Black's first move after the transition
          overlaps the last one before the transition, being used in the next
          stage of the recursion, so the final count of liberties is \( 2 + 2 -
          1 = 3 \). Another way to look at the transition is that Black's last
          move before the transition forces White's capture, so, each player
          having used their turn to play a local move, Black and White's last
          moves cancel each other out.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to note that capturing at <code>C</code> for White
          after Black <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> won't change the number
          of liberties of the group, unlike what happens in the Nakade #2, where
          the capture effectively loses liberties. This won't happen for the
          higher order cases, where capturing on the initial atari is the only
          correct move and does effectively grant more liberties to White.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="3_stone_clump_marked.PNG" />
          <figcaption>3-stone dead clump or Nakade #3.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Maybe this formulation will become clearer when we examine the next
          use case, the 4-stone dead clump. Black plays <code>B</code>,
          <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> and then enters the transition to
          the previous case in the recursion. So, we will have:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[ \begin{align} &stones \ played \ initially - 1 \ transition \\ &+
          previous \ case \ in \ the \ recursion \\ &=3 - 1 + 3 = 5 \ liberties
          \end{align} \]
        </p>
        <p>
          If you go through the end of the sequence, counting the overlapping
          transitions as only 1 move, you will end up with the same value of 5
          &mdash; and that reasoning is described in the SGF as well.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="4_stone_clump_marked.PNG" />
          <figcaption>4-stone dead clump or Nakade #4.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          I hope the recursion has become clearer by now. But let's take a look
          at the next important case, the 5-stone dead clump. Black plays
          <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>A</code> and <code>D</code>, and
          then White resets the position to the previous case in the recursion.
          Again, we have the formula:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[ \begin{align} &stones \ played \ initially - 1 \ transition \\ &+
          previous \ case \ in \ the \ recursion \\ &= 4 - 1 + 5 = 8 \ liberties
          \end{align} \]
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="5_stone_clump_marked.PNG" />
          <figcaption>5-stone dead clump or Nakade #5.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          So far, from what we've seen, we have the sequence \[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
          \], which coincides with the Fibonacci sequence quite neatly and
          naturally, but can we really say that for all cases? The examples
          shown above are pretty much 95% of all you will encounter in games.
          But there's still one important use case missing, the
          <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?RabbittySix">Rabbitty Six</a>, let's
          take a look at it.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I have to thank Simão Gonçalves for pointing out the exception to
            the Fibonacci reasoning that is the Rabbitty Six, otherwise my
            conclusion would have simply been an oversimplification. He has also
            thoroughly reviewed the whole article, something I'm even more
            thankful for.
          </p>

          <img src="rabbitty_six.PNG" />
          <figcaption>Rabbitty Six.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Black plays <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>D</code>,
          <code>E</code> and <code>F</code> before White resets the position and
          we get the previous case in the recursion. So, again, we can apply the
          formula:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[ \begin{align} &stones \ played \ initially - 1 \\ &transition +
          previous \ case \ in \ the \ recursion \\ &= 5 - 1 + 8 = 12
          \end{align} \]
        </p>
        <p>
          You can follow the step-by-step counting through the transitions in
          the SGF file if you're not convinced.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Generalizing"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          So, sadly, the capture-recapture with Nakades doesn't follow the
          Fibonacci sequence to the T, otherwise the Rabitty Six would have 13
          liberties. In fact, if you had been paying extra attention, you would
          have been very suspicious due to the presence of the \( -1 \) in the
          formula applied previously. Besides, we are not even summing two
          previous terms, but the previous terms and a new one.
        </p>
        <p>The general formulas are:</p>
        <p>
          \[ \begin{align} \# \ of \ liberties = \ &initial \ clump \ of \
          stones \ to \ atari - 1 \ transition \\ &+ previous \ case \ in \ the
          \ recursion \\ \# \ of \ liberties = \ &total \ stones \ played \ to \
          capture \\ &- \# \ of \ forced \ transitions \end{align} \]
        </p>
        <p>
          The second formula I will call the <em>Absolute Formula</em> because
          it counts the whole sequence; and the former will be called the
          <em>Recursive Fomula #1</em>. Alternatively, a more succinct form for
          them:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[ \begin{align} &amp;n_L(csa) = csa - 1 + n_L(csa - 1) \\ &amp;n_L =
          TS - FT \end{align} \]
        </p>
        <p>
          where \( n_L \) is the number of liberties, \( csa \) is the initial
          clump of stones up to to the first atari, \( TS \) is the total stones
          played to capture and \( FT \) is the forced transitions number.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I call forced transitions are the resets the player trying to
          save himself has to make in order to gain more liberties and not die
          immediately, they are basically the <em>only</em> correct move. So,
          for example, for the 3-stone clump, there are no forced transitions,
          because we still have only 3 liberties, whether White captures the
          initial 2 stones or not. The Nakade #2 and the Nakade #1 are also
          special, base cases and, as usual in almost all cases of recursive
          dynamics, base cases end up having to be treated differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to the absolute formula, it's important to note that \(
          FT \) could be defined in many different ways, depending on what you
          call a transition. But that wouldn't really matter much in the end, we
          would just have to adjust a correcting factor, like a \( +1 \) or \(
          -1 \) at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at the table below for a breakdown of the formulas, as
          applied to each use case:

        </table>
        <p>
          From the 3-stone clump on, you could also think it as &mdash; for the
          recursive formula &mdash;:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[ \begin{align} \# \ of \ liberties = \ &empty \ intersections \\ &-
          2 + previous \ case \ in \ the \ recursion \end{align} \]
        </p>
        <p>
          Why subtract 2? Because you're gonna play, up to the atari, all of the
          intersections except for 1, and you have to account for the
          overlapping transition. Let's call this last version of the formula

          (AP) starting from 1, with common difference of 1. For example, add 2
          to the calculation of the Nakade #6 and subtract 2 from the -3, then
          cancel the new -5 with the first 5:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[ \begin{align} n_L(6) &= (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) + 2 - 3 - 2 \\ &= (5 +
          4 + 3 + 2 + 1) + 2 - 5 \\ &= (4 + 3 + 2 + 1) + 2 \\ &= S_{AP}(4) + 2
          \\ &= S_{AP}(ei - 2) + 2 \\ &= \frac{(6 - 2) (6 - 2 + 1)}{2} + 2 = 12
          \end{align} \]
        </p>
        <p>So, another way to look at the whole is:</p>
        <p>\[ n_L(ei) = \frac{(ei - 2) (ei - 1)}{2} + 2 \]</p>
        <p>
          where \( ei \) is the total number of empty intersections internally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where does the \( +2 \) come from? Essentially from the Nakade #2 base
          case, I would say. And I can see many other formulas popping out from
          that point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last, AP-based, formula can even account for values as low as \( 2
          \ ei \) apparently:

          As an appendix, we have the
          <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?ButterflySeven">Butterfly Seven</a>,
          which is the first shape where we can finally find life, more
          specifically, a seki. Black <code>A</code> is followed by White
          <code>G</code>, then Black <code>E</code> and White <code>D</code> or
          <code>B</code>. I can't guarantee weird shapes with even weirder dead
          black stones inside would be all alive, but I think that 99.99% of the
          cases are covered by stopping our analysis of liberties at the
          Butterfly Seven.

          Congratulations on reading up to here. I bet most have quit after I
          mentioned counting liberties. As a prize, you get the coveted honor of
          solving a tsumego. I know, I know, and I agree: there aren't enough of
          those in this world, am I right?
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, I really doubt a 1 or 2 dan can solve this easily and with
          certainty. Finding the correct answer is not that hard, but proving it
          correct is a whole other level. And that level will open the door to
          easily solving even more complicated capturing races.

          In true fairness, do you really need all of that complicated
          reasoning? Not really, you could just remember the 6 use-cases above,
          the end. But dabbling in this will help you memorize the numbers, and
          this type of reasoning is useful for capturing races in general also.
          At any rate, demonstrating this to your fellow players will be quite a
          pleasant flex<foot-note text="Bodybuilding Go."></foot-note>.

            <a
              href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?FourIsFiveAndFiveIsEightAndSixIsTwelve#toc5"
              >In the summary section of the Big Eye page of Sensei's Library</a
            >, other users had already discussed about the AP-based formula I
            came up with here.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences has the
            <a href="http://oeis.org/A089071">A089071</a> sequence pointing to
            the exact recursive reasoning I describe here, though I think mine
            is more complete &#x1f61b;. Interestingly and unexpectedly, the
            registration of the sequence isn't that old: December 2003. Given
            that Go is 2000+ years old, I would have been very surprised if
            nobody had ever found about this before me.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Another topic I forgot to mention was the complexity of the growth of
          the sequence. The AP-based formula &mdash; a formula where each item
          will be the sum of an AP &mdash; shows that the liberties grow
          quadratically with respect to the internal empty intersections, i.e.,
          \( O(ei^2) \). That means it grows faster than most people would have
          expected, which is probably something close to linear behavior. That's
          why, when you hear someone scream in pain something like "why does it
          take forever for this to die?", you should have nothing but
          compassion.

        <custom-h2 text="Another Shape for the Zoo: Portal Seven"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          When originally preparing this article, I and Simão encountered some
          unusual shapes which could have been included here. However, we were
          reluctant to, because they seemed like exceptions or rarities. But
          there's one not-so-uncommon shape we missed, one I have the
          opportunity to baptize: the <em>Portal Seven</em>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="Portal 7.PNG" alt="Portal Seven" />
          <figcaption>
            Portal Seven. The name comes from it looking like a person going
            through a portal.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          At first, like me, you will probably think this shape to be incredibly
          rare. But it isn't that difficult to have it in your games actually.
          Often, you will need a series of mistakes or very forceful moves to
          have it come by, as in the diagram below:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Portal 7 - How it comes to be.PNG"
            alt="Portal 7 - How it comes to be"
          />
          <figcaption>
            How it might come to be. This example is inspired by
            <a href="https://online-go.com/game/38650411"
              >this game I reviewed</a
            >.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The <em>Portal Seven</em> is basically the next iteration of the
          formula, so the number of liberties would be the same as a Nakade #7 =
          17. But there are already 2 white stones inside, so it actually
          amounts to 15 liberties, which is nothing short of astounding, at any
          rate. How many capturing races can you win with that many liberties? A
          lot of them, for sure.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the last diagram above, there are already 3 white stones inside, so
          the Black group has 14 internal liberties, and there's also the
          question if he's gonna be able to get <code>A</code> or not, otherwise
          he won't have the complete shape and its liberties might drastically
          lower.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's worth also noting that a "naked" <em>Portal Seven</em> is not a
          dead shape actually, as seen below.
        </p>

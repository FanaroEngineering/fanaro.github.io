      <h1>Why Play Go: A More Thorough Exploration Than Usual</h1>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Introduction and Context"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          Some 5+ years ago, when I was around 5k, I was finally experiencing
          for the first time a true Go club's atmosphere, in Brussels, Belgium.
          I had already experienced something close to it in Brazil, but usually
          there were no DDKs nor beginners anywhere to be seen, or at least not
          near me.
        </p>

        <p>
          With that typical atmosphere comes a lot of beginners and onlookers.
          Usually I think I would do a decent-to-good job at teaching beginners,
          or showing something that would convey a part of its beauty. However,
          week after week, month after month, the lessons would have to be
          repeated, in an endless cycle. Slowly, I realized 90%+ of all
          beginners didn't come back. Despite slowly improving my teaching
          skills and trying out new stories and facts, nothing worked to change
          that statistic.
        </p>

        <p>
          After pondering and discussing with friends we came to the conclusion
          that this was an unsolvable problem:
          <em>interest in Go is inherently subjective</em>, we thought. Just
          like we didn't have much interest in chess, other people weren't keen
          on learning much about Go, and that's all fair play.
        </p>

        <p>
          Years went by and I ended up in South Korea, studying Go and other
          topics related to it &mdash; I wrote about my stay
          <local-link
            text="here"
            link="https://fanaro.io/articles/on_korea/on_korea.html"
          ></local-link
          >. After clogging my interest in Go with other areas of life, I
          managed something very unexpected: I almost outright killed my
          interest in Go completely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shocked by how I managed to turn 5+ years of love into almost complete
          indifference, I've been revisiting the topic of
          <em>why play Go</em> time and time again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though interest and motivation are inherently subjective indeed,
          they are also subject to human psychology, software which is common us
          all, so there must be insights which would help us understand what
          would drive <strike>seemingly sane</strike> humans to devote so much
          time to the game of Go.
        </p>

        <p>
          And indeed there are many. In fact, there's a whole subfield of
          psychology dedicated to motivation. Unfortunately, I'm not a
          psychologist &mdash; I'm a software engineer... did you guess it?
          &mdash;, so what I will provide is largely based on my experience,
          reflections and the little I managed to absorb from accessible
          books<foot-note
            text="I haven't yet visited Dan Pink's nor Dan Ariely's books yet.
            I'll leave it to a follow-up article in the future."
          ></foot-note
          >, articles, and videos. Hopefully this will be a spark for a
          psychologist who happens to be interested in Go to follow up.
        </p>

        <p>The outline of the article is composed of mainly 3 parts:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Exploring from the top the realm of motivation, while incorporating
            some wisdom I've collected from so other informal sources
          </li>
          <li>
            Players' and other notable individuals' takes on this topic, their
            opinions and reflections
          </li>
          <li>
            My main reason for playing the game, which I've only fully come to
            recently
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Lastly, I've also enumerated all of the references I've used to come
          up with the content within this article. Boy, do I wish I had access
          to that content when 5+ years ago!

        <p>
          All the technology in the world, and we still get closer and closer,
          more than ever, to self-destruction as a species, all due to
          political, psychological and sociological incompetence and ignorance.
          Problems like pandemics and climate change continue to creep in, and
          we've reached the point where they are more threatening &mdash; in
          terms of likelihood at least &mdash; than nuclear warfare.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's 2021 and we still keep repeating all the political mistakes
          Ancient Greece pointed out, more than 2000 years ago. It's 2021 and we
          still have mostly utilitarian educational and economic structures
          which treat humans as axiomatic machines. The major challenge for
          humanity during this century might be realizing that the human race
          actually depends on humans, not on physics or math: taking phallic
          objects into space might represent opportunity cost regression rather
          than progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          How the heck has this supposedly Go article digressed into a
          sociopolitical rant? Let me explain...
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc">As Dan Pink mentions</a>, a lot
          of our business and educational praxis is based on scientifically
          <em>disproven</em> concepts. For example, how about one of
          mainstream's favorite economic axioms:
          <em>rewarding certain types of behaviors incentivizes them</em>. Is it
          really true or false? Or is it somewhere in the middle?
        </p>

        <p>
          Again, that axiom is too math-like, some economics even refer to it as
          some sort of social-physics law. That should be an indication that it
          is an oversimplification of human behavior. Throughout the last 3-4
          decades, consistently, time and again, psychology researchers have
          reproduced results which diverge from that adage, and some of those
          studies were even sponsored by the US Federal Reserve. In the end,
          what they concluded was that it only holds true for physical,
          repetitive work, much like for factory workers. However, whenever
          anything that involved even rudimentary thinking was involved, rewards
          actually were detrimental to completing a task.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rewards actually serve as focus boosts, we narrow our minds to a
          target. But, when trying to solve intellectual puzzles, it is often
          counter-productive to have such narrow focus, because our space of
          exploration becomes drastically smaller, we need to think outside the
          box.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think of what has been motivating you in Go for instance, what has
          been keeping you persisting? Has it been about intrinsic or extrinsic
          motivation?
        </p>

        <p>
          Extrinsic motivation comes from, you guessed it, outside the person.
          Examples could be compensation &mdash; money or services &mdash;,
          punishments or other types of rewards. Intrinsic factors, on the other
          hand, are usually linked to autonomy, mastery and purpose. Studies
          have shown that intrisically motivated people are more likely to
          persist on a task, for they focus on learning; while extrinsically
          motivated individuals are focused on outcomes. Since there isn't a
          relevant pool of monetary or physical reward in Go, most people keep
          on practicing it because they are intrinsically motivated. But it is
          unlikely you've <em>never</em> had to deal with extrinsic factors in
          Go actually.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have you ever been mad about your rank being low, or have you ever
          tried to keep your rank high? That might be the beginnings of
          extrinsic motivators creeping into your initially purely intrinsic
          activity. Other people's praise or critique might serve as extrinsic
          motivation or demotivation as well, and, slowly, you will feel the
          outer world interfere in what you initially treasured as your solitary
          intellectual journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nonetheless, most people keep on going, even after having conflicts
          with other people's opinions and suffering rank-damaging losses. Or at
          least they do before they realize something that studies have shown
          when you mix both types of motivators together: intrinsic motivation
          suffers when mixed with extrinsic motivation. You might think you
          could at some point isolate both worlds, clean everything up and then
          go back to normalsy with purely intrinsic motivation, but research
          demonstrates that, once extrinsic motivation is mixed in, the allure
          is never the same again. For example, once hobby chefs begin to be
          compensated for their work, their intrinsic passion suffers, so much
          so that some end up quitting outright &mdash; the overjustification
          effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          The picture I'm painting looks bleak, once Pandora's box is open,
          there's no coming back apparently. Should we then isolate ourselves
          and practice Go in a vaccum? I would advise you not to, since it
          doesn't seem healthy, and conquering this psychological challenge
          might unlock the key other challenges in life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps another helpful nugget of wisdom from Dan Pink might be that
          money, as an incentive, works best when it is enough to make us forget
          about monetary issues. So, when trying to minimize the intrusion of
          extrinsic factors, having just enough of them to make you forget about
          them might be the optimal solution. In order to achieve just that, I
          think the key is to surround ourselves with psychologically conscious
          and supportive people, and discuss openly with them whatever has been
          annoying you. Don't let these pains pile up, and don't stay in
          environments overblowing your ego either.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="Praise"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          Much like reward, another ill-understood concept is <em>praise</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Praise is a type of reward, so you can apply what was discussed in the
          previous subsection to your benefit. But it is also a very specific
          and common type of reward. In an ideal world, I believe both the
          teacher and student would be very conscious of how to deal with this
          psychological tool, and all of us will end up on receiving and giving
          ends, in the near or far future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Again, I'm not a psychologist, nor a notable kiss ass, but I've had my
          fair share or high praises and harsh criticism, on both ends. From
          that experience, much like most introverts I know, I would rather not
          really receive praise or criticism because most people don't know how
          to make it useful &mdash; often criticism is useful actually, since
          the other person usually needs to compare it to what's deemed right,
          not only confirm something as correct &mdash;, so they go for purely
          emotional takes, positive or negative. Bloating other people's egos
          can be helpful when it comes to immediate performance<foot-note
            text="Georges St-Pierre, for example, legendary MMA fighter, argues that
            confidence can be worth very high physical or technical abilities,
            and it is a skill practitioners should learn how to master as well."
          ></foot-note
          >, but it can also have negative impact in the long-term.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even if, much like me, you're still on the avoiding praise/criticism
          side, it's useful to learn a bit more about this topic, so you can
          deal with the unavoidable in a better way.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are usually two main types of subjects of praise: effort and
          abilities. I don't have the statistics of which type is more common
          than the other but I do remember more vividly praises of the shape
          "you're very good at...", "you have a knack for ...". These types of
          praises incentivize the ability side of your being and, if done
          consistently, will grow a specific mindset in your mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          The specific mindset you get from ability praises tends to be more
          fixed, since it is an argument based on innate characteristics. It
          does offer a lot of confidence boost to the receiver, however, it is a
          limiting frame, since you supposedly cannot outgrow your innate
          capabilities. The people who then fall into this category will likely
          focus on choosing tasks which fit their level cognition on a safe
          level, perhaps even falling into safe tasks, ultimately mediocrity.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, effort is something we can all put in, no matter
          how limited or powerful we are &mdash; even if you rate yourself bad
          at math, do you really think you wouldn't get any better if you
          invested a considerable amount of time and effort into it? No matter
          who we are, we can all be better, this is the growth mindset. Studies
          have even shown that students with the growth mindset will challenge
          themselves more often, and ultimately outperform students of the fixed
          mindset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being aware of what type of praise you're giving or receiving makes
          you far less likely to fall into unexpected psychological traps in the
          future. And I also believe it would be far healthier if we all
          defaulted to the growth mindset type of praise, instead of praising
          unchangeable features, or randomly choosing whatever comes to mind
          first. This bias towards effort complements well tasks more suited to
          a priori gifted individuals, offering psychological incentives to what
          we can actively change.

          text="Dr. K's Unexpectedly Simple and Wise Take on Motivation"
        ></custom-h3>

        <!-- TODO: Mention Dr. K's take on motivation -->

        <p>
          Dr. K is the main contributor to and creator of the
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHVl2N3jPEbkNJVx-ItQIQ"
            >HealthyGamerGG channel</a
          >. Quite frankly, at first, I thought his channel would be yet another
          rehash of the cosmic-meditation panacea pseudo-science many
          self-proclaimed gurus are plaguing YouTube with. However, he's much
          deeper than that. Dr. K is a psychiatrist and consultant, dealing with
          gaming vices and other mental syndromes. He has also helped many
          parents educate their children in a healthier manner. All of his
          wisdom has partially come from his own suffering, since he mentions he
          still has a lot of trouble focusing and adapting to business
          environments. Part of his psychological know-how comes from ancient
          Indian philosophy and practical psychology, which he gathered from
          studying in India himself.
        </p>

        <p>
          When it comes to motivation,
          <a href="https://youtu.be/3QWIxElEnc8">one of his videos</a> was
          actually the one that finally triggered me into writing this article.
          In it, he finally offers something I could consider a solid definition
          of motivation:
        </p>

        <p class="indented-paragraph">
          <em>
            Motivation is the ability of holding a thought &mdash; usually an
            interest or goal &mdash; in your mind.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that there isn't anything even close to mystical in that
          definition, which also, incidentally, comes from an Indian
          psychiatrist who's also an advocate of meditation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even more importantly, note that there is no mention of behaviors
          there either. Motivation is within the mind, it is not externalized
          nor externalizable, not in terms of behavior at least. The main
          problem with our culture and education when it comes to motivation is
          that they just can't seem to get the last part of the last sentence.
          Saying something like "just do it" is thus the definition of not
          understanding motivation at all. In the end we will have to do
          something in order to achieve our goals, nevertheless: emulating
          behavior does not equate emulating thoughts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interestingly, there's a difference between motivation and desire, at
          least in the realm of psychology. Desire is a term typically
          associated with sensory stimulus, which might or might not impart
          motivation, but is usually something instinctive, more associated with
          something ephemeral or the limbic system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another related term is anxiety. When it comes to motivation, anxiety
          usually refers to the consequences of doing or not doing what you want
          to accomplish, it is a powerful way of getting rid of motivation.
          That's probably why overthinking and analysis paralysis are so closely
          linked to losing motivation as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. K also mentions that goals are actually usually not what motivates
          people, most motivated people are focused on the process at hand,
          either enjoying or going through the moment. For motivated people,
          goals serve typically was checkpoints, as guides and compasses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly to the clearer concept of motivation explained above,
          self-discipline is also an emergent property, you cannot emulate a
          disciplined person's behavior and expect to end up with the same
          mindset. Self-discipline is the externalized behavior of someone
          trying to keep a thought in his or her head.

          If you want to take a look on the crude notes this whole article comes
          from, it is <a href="Feedback on Why Play Go.md">here</a>, I just
          can't guarantee it is very readable.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This section is a little bit more down to earth and not so much on the
          meta-meta psycho-philosophical discussion we had in the previous
          section. Here we discuss topics you could mention directly to a
          beginner &mdash; instead of discussion a random article on the
          internet for an hour &mdash;, such as Go being much like martial arts
          in terms of self-expression and combat, or Go improving analytical
          skills, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason this part of the article isn't really its core is because I
          wasn't convinced any of it is something you could only get through Go.
          I believe that there are countless sports which offer the same or most
          of the same benefits and lessons, so it's actually quite difficult to
          convince anyone through this line of reasoning. But you may believe
          otherwise, of course &mdash; and the argument could also be applied to
          someone trying to convince you to practice another sport instead of Go
          &mdash;; at any rate, I expose the only uniquely Go reason I've found
          in the next section.

                However, it's worth noting that, in order to use whatever you
                learn in Go or other sports, you will need to generalize the
                concepts, otherwise they will only be localized to Go forever,
                and you will never be aware of the connections.

            Go is like interactive art<foot-note text="Like sex?"></foot-note>,
            so we should focus on building together a better experience, it

          </li>
          <li>
            Go features a lot of the art of abstraction, used in math, physics
            and other exact sciences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everything human is there, without the annoying, noisy parts. You
            can learn about the emotions of fighting &mdash; even though not
            fighting itself &mdash; with no need for the body to intervene or
            serve as a medium.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your life is monotonous, Go will be the perfect pass-time for
            you. On the other hand, if your life demands a lot of mental effort,
            you might find it hard to play Go later in the day.
          </li>
          <li>
            No more videogames: this ultimate game will simply dominate your
            gaming interest if you end up liking it. It's gonna be a lifetime
            hobby in which you can always improve and learn, few games and
            hobbies have such depth and longevity.
            <ul>
              <li>
                This also goes for board games, albeit in a smaller scale.

            Since Go is so obscure/niche, there's special joy and pride in
            discovering things, because they are difficult to come by. Whenever
            you do, it's almost like (re)discovering a theorem.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's like Minecraft, but better, in terms of building your own
            patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even though it's not as visually and physically stimulating as Jiu
            Jitsu or other sports, you're gonna be able to enjoy Go pretty much
            anywhere, like at a bar, at home, with friends, in competition,
            alone, etc. And physical stamina won't be such a deterrent for
            practicing it for long periods of time.
          </li>
          <li>Tsumegos are really fun exercises to people who like puzzles.</li>
          <li>There is no risk of physical injuries in Go.</li>
          <li>The game is aesthetically beautiful.</li>
          <li>
            Much like art, you could also simply appreciate it, not necessarily
            play it, although learning more about it might improve the sense of
            appreciation.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will also learn how to deal better with winning or losing. And,
            by the way, keep in mind that 30-40% win rate is the more ideal rate
            for maintaining interest in a game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go will teach you the power of context, as sequences in vaccum can
            differ drastically from sequences in a real game.
          </li>
          <li>
            The power of fundamentals and basic techniques is very evident in
            Go, and their proper application is just as important to a beginner
            as it is to a master. It's part of the fractal process of learning
            and improving Go.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sports where you can only use your brain instead of your physique
            offer you more emphasis on the ability of developing a stronger
            mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            The board offers an opportunity to work with other parts of
            ourselves. For example, if you're a violent person, you might be
            able to exercise your pacifist side.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you like martial arts and fighting, you're bound to like Go. It's
            like mind fighting.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Go community tends to be of a much more intellectual and polite
            kind, which results and more positive interactions in general.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specially in the opening stages, Go feels similarly to drawing,
            i.e., you will be able to draw and dance around with a lot of
            freedom before any interaction happens.
          </li>
          <li>
            Through the process of reviewing, right from the get-go, beginners
            learn how to teach, which is not common in most sports. In many
            sports and even professions, in order to be able to practice
            teaching, you need to reach a high level at the craft.
          </li>
          <li>
            Given that none of us &mdash; Westerners and late-learners &mdash;
            will likely ever be anyone in the Go world, we end up having to
            learn how to humble ourselves and better level our expectaions.
            Eventually, I believe most amateur players should actually focus on
            the psychological benefits Go is able to bring us.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Go has taught me more than university itself, or the sports I

              </li>
              <li>
                Go is an accelerated, isolated simulation of your inner psyche.

            Learning something everyday should be the top-most priority when it

            will be able to apply in many other areas of life. And it is also a

                Go could also be a bridge to understanding modern AI, like

                Personally, I was inspired to learn Go because of a scientific

            Since this is a mental sport, you can enjoy it for way longer than
            any other sport, and continue to improve even after your 40s or 50s.

          <li>
            Specially at the beginning, there's so much to learn that you will
            likely feel overwhelmed. Slowly, hopefully, you will adapt and be
            able to break the content into categories and hierarchies, much like
            when learning a new language.

          <li>
            You will realize that need volume and repetition in order to learn.
            No staring into the same thing forever will make you good at
            anything. This is generalizable to other areas of life as well.

            It's also important to tell the student how long it takes to get

            Go, specially the process of reviewing games, is very analogous to
            pair programming, a common, good practice in software engineering.
            For programming, Go can be seen as quite a good intellectual
            challenge as well.

              <li>
                Tangible rewards (i.e., money) tend to have more negative
                effects on intrinsic motivation than do intangible rewards

                In educational settings, students are more likely to experience
                intrinsic motivation to learn when they feel a sense of

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This internalization can be enhanced if the evaluative
                    aspects of the classroom are de-emphasized and if students
                    feel that they exercise some control over the learning
                    environment.

              <li>
                William James (1842–1910) was an important contributor to early
                research into motivation, and he is often referred to as the
                father of psychology in the United States. James theorized that
                behavior was driven by a number of instincts, which aid survival
              </li>
              <li>
                Another early theory of motivation proposed that the maintenance
                of homeostasis is particularly important in directing behavior.
                You may recall from your earlier reading that homeostasis is the
                tendency to maintain a balance, or optimal level, within a
                biological system.
              </li>
              <li>
                According to the drive theory of motivation, deviations from
                homeostasis create physiological needs. These needs result in
                psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need
                and, ultimately, bring the system back to homeostasis.

                If we are underaroused, we become bored and will seek out some
                sort of stimulation. On the other hand, if we are overaroused,
                we will engage in behaviors to reduce our arousal (Berlyne,
                1960).

                Self-efficacy is an individual’s belief in her own capability to
                complete a task, which may include a previous successful
                completion of the exact task or a similar task.
              </li>
              <li>
                A number of theorists have focused their research on
                understanding social motives (McAdams &amp; Constantian, 1983;
                McClelland &amp; Liberman, 1949; Murray et al., 1938). Among the
                motives they describe are needs for achievement, affiliation,
                and intimacy. It is the need for achievement that drives
                accomplishment and performance. (...)

          As mentioned in the introduction, the question surrounding this
          article has been in my mind for ages. And one of the most puzzling
          factors in answering it was that I couldn't even answer it for myself,
          let alone motivate other people. It also felt hypocritical to try to
          convince others when I could barely make sense of my own thoughts.

          At first, I tried to trace back what was driving me at the beginning,
          when I first learned Go in 2012, at the age of 20 &mdash; I was born
          in 1992. I first heard of Go in a Physics lecture in my Electrical
          Engineering course, where the professor mentioned Go because it was
          being used to study phagocytosis in fungi &mdash; much like when
          surrounding territories in Go, if you stretch yourself too thin, you
          won't be able to "catch and kill" whatever comes inside. My initial
          interest was purely as a foreign curiosity, I wanted to see how
          complexity and strategy could emerge from very simple rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, tracing Go back to its personal origins didn't help much
          because my motivation sources slowly changed. As I got better at the
          game itself, I became more and more focused on learning and improving
          &mdash; surprisingly I've never had any intentions of being super
          strong or "the best ever", I just enjoyed learning and getting better.
          My peak interest at getting better I believe was when I coincidentally
          was in Europe, studying engineering. Slowly, though, unbeknownst to
          me, my interests shifted again, I think.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon having contact with very strong European players I was finally
          able to realize the amount of time and effort I would have to invest
          in order to reach their levels. It was frustrating but slowly I
          decided to slowly put Go to the side and focus on on other areas of my
          life.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was then that I started to come up with the real reason for playing
          Go: the players. Thinking back on all the people I've met through Go
          so far &mdash; excepting beginners, i.e., only those who have
          practiced it a bit &mdash;, I don't think I've ever met a single
          unininteresting person, which is nothing short of astonishing. I've
          had a good share of unpleasantness, much like anyone else, but even
          the unpleasant people were interesting, people you could learn from.

          In Haskell, a functional programming language in vogue right now, they
          say that it is impossible to hire a bad Haskell programmer. The
          rationale is that, in order to learn Haskell, you need to learn so
          many things first that, by the time you've reached full Haskell
          proficiency, you're a top-notch overall programmer &mdash; old timers
          say Python used to be this way as well, but it has now been heavily
          commodified. Go has a similar feeling to me: in order to become decent
          at it, you will need to make sense of so much seemingly unrelated
          stuff that you will end up being quite the interesting individual!

          It is quite interesting to see my shift in motivation go from being
          almost purely intrinsic to extrinsic, but I don't think one excludes
          the other, I still would like to improve, and that's a big part of why
          I still love it, it's just not as big an influence anymore.

          Part of the reason I created this blog and article was with the
          intention of giving back to the community and players who had helped

          the way I do it sometimes, but I only do it this way because it is
          ultimately <em>my</em> opinion.

          I've started training in (Brazilian) Jiu Jitsu in the last few months
          mostly to feel the beginner's mind set again, so I could better
          understand what goes in the mind of a Go beginner. So far, I'm very
          much surprised at how similar the paths to mastery are in Jiu Jitsu
          and Go, no wonder they were deemed similar in Japan, I guess. Two
          people who have surprised me a lot in terms of wisdom are John
          Danaher, currently a living legend in BJJ and MMA, and Nicholas Albin,
          also known Chewy, from his own channel
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/chewybjj">Chewjitsu</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dan Pink and Dan Ariely are two notable contributors to related areas
          of psychology, and their insights are excellent and comprehensible.
          Unfortunately, I either wasn't aware of them or couldn't link them to
          this topic soon enough, their content will have to wait for a future,

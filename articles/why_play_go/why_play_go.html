      <h1>Why Play Go: A More Thorough Exploration Than Usual</h1>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Introduction and Context"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          Some 5+ years ago, when I was around 5k, I was finally experiencing
          for the first time a true Go club's atmosphere, in Brussels, Belgium.
          I had already experienced something close to it in Brazil, but usually
          there were no DDKs nor beginners anywhere to be seen, or at least not
          near me.
        </p>

        <p>
          With that typical atmosphere comes a lot of beginners and onlookers.
          Usually I think I would do a decent-to-good job at teaching beginners,
          or showing something that would convey a part of its beauty. However,
          week after week, month after month, the lessons would have to repeated
          endlessly. Slowly, I realized 90%+ of all beginners didn't come back.
          Despite slowly improving my teaching skills and trying out new stories
          and facts, nothing worked to change that statistic.
        </p>

        <p>
          After pondering and discussing with friends we came to the conclusion
          that this was an unsolvable problem:
          <em>interest in Go is inherently subjective</em>, we thought. Just
          like we didn't have much interest in chess, other people weren't keen
          on learning much about Go, and that's all fair play.
        </p>

        <p>
          Years went by and I ended up in South Korea, studying Go and other
          topics related to it &mdash; I wrote about my stay
          <local-link
            text="here"
            link="https://fanaro.io/articles/on_korea/on_korea.html"
          ></local-link
          >. After clogging my interest in Go with other areas of life, I
          managed something very unexpected: I almost outright killed my
          interest in Go completely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shocked by how I managed to turn 5+ years of love into almost complete
          indifference, I've been revisiting the topic of
          <em>why play Go</em> time and time again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though interest and motivation are inherently subjective indeed,
          they are also subject to human psychology, software which is common us
          all, so there must be insights which would help us understand what
          would drive <strike>seemingly sane</strike> humans to devote so much
          time to the game of Go.
        </p>

        <p>
          And indeed there are many. In fact, there's a whole subfield of
          psychology dedicated to motivation. Unfortunately, I'm not a
          psychologist &mdash; I'm a software engineer... did you guess it?
          &mdash;, so what I will provide is largely based on my experience,
          reflections and the little I managed to absorb from accessible
          books<foot-note
            text="I haven't yet visited Dan Pink's nor Dan Ariely's books yet.
            I'll leave it to a follow-up article in the future."
          ></foot-note
          >, articles, and videos. Hopefully this will be a spark for a
          psychologist who happens to be interested in Go to follow up.
        </p>

        <p>The outline of the article is composed of mainly 3 parts:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Exploring from the top the realm of motivation, while incorporating
            some wisdom I've collected from so other informal sources
          </li>
          <li>
            Players' and other notable individuals' takes on this topic, their
            opinions and reflections
          </li>
          <li>
            My main reason for playing the game, which I've only fully come to
            recently
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Lastly, I've also enumerated all of the references I've used to come
          up with the content within this article. Boy, do I wish I had access
          to that content when 5+ years ago!

          some might be very indirect. At any rate, I believe they will all

        <p>
          I've started training in (Brazilian) Jiu Jitsu in the last few months
          mostly to feel the beginner's mind set again, so I could better
          understand what goes in the mind of a Go beginner. So far, I'm very
          much surprised at how similar the paths to mastery are in Jiu Jitsu
          and Go, no wonder they were deemed similar in Japan, I guess. Two
          people who have surprised me a lot in terms of wisdom are John
          Danaher, currently a living legend in BJJ and MMA, and Nicholas Albin,
          also known Chewy, from his own channel
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/chewybjj">Chewjitsu</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dan Pink and Dan Ariely are two notable contributors to related areas
          of psychology, and their insights are excellent and comprehensible.
          Unfortunately, I either wasn't aware of them or couldn't link them to
          this topic soon enough, their content will have to wait for a future,
          follow-up article.

          playback so you can breeze through all these videos. Having the
          ability of &mdash; consistently &mdash; watching videos, i.e.
          audio-visual live performances, is life-changing.

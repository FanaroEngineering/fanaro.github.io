      <h1>Why Play Go: A More Thorough Exploration Than Usual</h1>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Introduction and Context"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          Some 5+ years ago, when I was around 5k, I was finally experiencing
          for the first time a true Go club's atmosphere, in Brussels, Belgium.
          I had already experienced something close to it in Brazil, but usually
          there were no DDKs nor beginners anywhere to be seen, or at least not
          near me.
        </p>

        <p>
          With that typical atmosphere comes a lot of beginners and onlookers.
          Usually I think I would do a decent-to-good job at teaching beginners,
          or showing something that would convey a part of its beauty. However,
          week after week, month after month, the lessons would have to repeated
          endlessly. Slowly, I realized 90%+ of all beginners didn't come back.
          Despite slowly improving my teaching skills and trying out new stories
          and facts, nothing worked to change that statistic.
        </p>

        <p>
          After pondering and discussing with friends we came to the conclusion
          that this was an unsolvable problem:
          <em>interest in Go is inherently subjective</em>, we thought. Just
          like we didn't have much interest in chess, other people weren't keen
          on learning much about Go, and that's all fair play.
        </p>

        <p>
          Years went by and I ended up in South Korea, studying Go and other
          topics related to it &mdash; I wrote about my stay
          <local-link
            text="here"
            link="https://fanaro.io/articles/on_korea/on_korea.html"
          ></local-link
          >. After clogging my interest in Go with other areas of life, I
          managed something very unexpected: I almost outright killed my
          interest in Go completely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shocked by how I managed to turn 5+ years of love into almost complete
          indifference, I've been revisiting the topic of
          <em>why play Go</em> time and time again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though interest and motivation are inherently subjective indeed,
          they are also subject to human psychology, software which is common us
          all, so there must be insights which would help us understand what
          would drive <strike>seemingly sane</strike> humans to devote so much
          time to the game of Go.
        </p>

        <p>
          And indeed there are many. In fact, there's a whole subfield of
          psychology dedicated to motivation. Unfortunately, I'm not a
          psychologist &mdash; I'm a software engineer... did you guess it?
          &mdash;, so what I will provide is largely based on my experience,
          reflections and the little I managed to absorb from accessible
          books<foot-note
            text="I haven't yet visited Dan Pink's nor Dan Ariely's books yet.
            I'll leave it to a follow-up article in the future."
          ></foot-note
          >, articles, and videos. Hopefully this will be a spark for a
          psychologist who happens to be interested in Go to follow up.
        </p>

        <p>The outline of the article is composed of mainly 3 parts:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Exploring from the top the realm of motivation, while incorporating
            some wisdom I've collected from so other informal sources
          </li>
          <li>
            Players' and other notable individuals' takes on this topic, their
            opinions and reflections
          </li>
          <li>
            My main reason for playing the game, which I've only fully come to
            recently
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Lastly, I've also enumerated all of the references I've used to come
          up with the content within this article. Boy, do I wish I had access
          to that content when 5+ years ago!

        <p>
          All the technology in the world, and we still get closer and closer,
          more than ever, to self-destruction as a species, all due to
          political, psychological and sociological incompetence and ignorance.
          Problems like pandemics and climate change continue to creep in, and
          we've reached the point where they are more threatening &mdash; in
          terms of likelihood at least &mdash; than nuclear warfare.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's 2021 and we still keep repeating all the political mistakes
          Ancient Greece pointed out, more than 2000 years ago. It's 2021 and we
          still have mostly utilitarian educational and economic structures
          which treat humans as axiomatic machines. The major challenge for
          humanity during this century might be realizing that the human race
          actually depends on humans, not on physics or math: taking phallic
          objects into space might represent opportunity cost regression rather
          than progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          How the heck has this supposedly Go article digressed into a
          sociopolitical rant? Let me explain...
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc">As Dan Pink mentions</a>, a lot
          of our business and educational praxis is based on scientifically
          <em>disproven</em> concepts. For example, how about one of
          mainstream's favorite economic axioms:
          <em>rewarding certain types of behaviors incentivizes them</em>. Is it
          really true or false? Or is it somewhere in the middle?
        </p>

        <p>
          Again, that axiom is too math-like, some economics even refer to it as
          some sort of social-physics law. That should be an indication that it
          is an oversimplification of human behavior. Throughout the last 3-4
          decades, consistently, time and again, psychology researchers have
          reproduced results which diverge from that adage, and some of those
          studies were even sponsored by the US Federal Reserve. In the end,
          what they concluded was that it only holds true for physical,
          repetitive work, much like for factory workers. However, whenever
          anything that involved even rudimentary thinking was involved, rewards
          actually were detrimental to completing a task.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rewards actually serve us focus boosts, we narrow our minds to a
          target. But, when trying to solve intellectual puzzles, it is often
          counter-productive to have such narrow focus, because our space of
          exploration becomes drastically smaller, we need to think outside the
          box.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think of what has been motivating you in Go for instance, what has
          been keeping you persisting? Has it been about intrinsic or extrinsic
          motivation?
        </p>

        <p>
          Extrinsic motivation comes from, you guessed it, outside the person.
          Examples could be compensation &mdash; money or services &mdash;,
          punishments or other types of rewards. Intrinsic factors, on the other
          hand, are usually linked to autonomy, mastery and purpose. Studies
          have shown that intrisically motivated people are more likely to
          persist on a task, for they focus on learning; while extrinsically
          motivated individuals are focused on outcomes. Since there isn't a
          relevant pool of monetary or physical reward in Go, most people keep
          on practicing it because they are intrinsically motivated. But it is
          unlikely you've <em>never</em> had to deal with extrinsic factors in
          Go actually.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have you ever been mad about your rank being low, or have you ever
          tried to keep your rank high? That might be the beginnings of
          extrinsic motivators creeping into your initially purely intrinsic
          activity. Other people's praise or critique might serve as extrinsic
          motivation or demotivation as well, and, slowly, you will feel the
          outer world interfere in what you initially treasured as your solitary
          intellectual journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nonetheless, most people keep on going, even after having conflicts
          with other people's opinions and suffering rank-damaging losses. Or at
          least they do before they realize something that studies have shown
          when you mix both types of motivators together: intrinsic motivation
          suffers when mixed with extrinsic motivation. You might think you
          could at some point isolate both worlds, clean everything up and then
          go back to normalsy with purely intrinsic motivation, but research
          demonstrates that, once extrinsic motivation is mixed in, the allure
          is never the same again. For example, once hobby chefs begin to be
          compensated for their work, their intrinsic passion suffers, so much
          so that some end up quitting outright.
        </p>

        <p>
          The picture I'm painting looks bleak, once Pandora's box is open,
          there's no coming back apparently. Should we then isolate ourselves
          and practice Go in a vaccum? I would advise you not to, since it
          doesn't seem healthy, and conquering this psychological challenge
          might unlock the key other challenges in life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps another helpful nugget of wisdom from Dan Pink might be that
          money, as an incentive, works best when it is enough to make us forget
          about monetary issues. So, when trying to minimize the intrusion of
          extrinsic factors, having just enough of them to make you forget about
          them might be the optimal solution. In order to achieve just that, I
          think the key is to surround ourselves with psychologically conscious
          and supportive people, and discuss openly with them whatever has been
          annoying you. Don't let these pains pile up, and don't stay in
          environments overblowing your ego either.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="Praise"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          Much like reward, another ill-understood concept is <em>praise</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Praise is a type of reward, so you can apply what was discussed in the
          previous subsection to your benefit. But it is also a very specific
          and common type of reward. In an ideal world, I believe both the
          teacher and student would be very conscious of how to deal with this
          psychological tool, and all of us will end up on receiving and giving
          ends, in the near or far future.
        </p>

        <p>Again, I'm not a psychologist, nor a notable kiss ass.</p>

          I've started training in (Brazilian) Jiu Jitsu in the last few months
          mostly to feel the beginner's mind set again, so I could better
          understand what goes in the mind of a Go beginner. So far, I'm very
          much surprised at how similar the paths to mastery are in Jiu Jitsu
          and Go, no wonder they were deemed similar in Japan, I guess. Two
          people who have surprised me a lot in terms of wisdom are John
          Danaher, currently a living legend in BJJ and MMA, and Nicholas Albin,
          also known Chewy, from his own channel
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/chewybjj">Chewjitsu</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dan Pink and Dan Ariely are two notable contributors to related areas
          of psychology, and their insights are excellent and comprehensible.
          Unfortunately, I either wasn't aware of them or couldn't link them to
          this topic soon enough, their content will have to wait for a future,
          follow-up article.

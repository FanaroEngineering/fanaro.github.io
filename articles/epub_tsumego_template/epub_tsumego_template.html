      <p>
        Ever since I was able to download
        <a href="https://gobooks.com/">GoBooks'</a> EPUB books, I am in love
        with digital Go books. It's just so much more practical and speedier to
        read in that format, specially due to the infinite scrolling<foot-note
          text="Infinite scrolling allows for your eyes to focus constantly at 
          the same point, reducing their movement. Reducing eye movement is one 
          of the principles of speed reading."
        ></foot-note
        >, that I wish all my books were EPUBs now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do note this is different from a PDF. PDFs were made to be printed, it's
        the printable document format after all, they were actually not made to
        be read on a screen. EPUBs, on the other hand, offer basically
        everything you wish were available when using a digital screen or
        device, such as changing fonts, font size, spacing, alignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, EPUBs might seem ugly, but that's usually due to the reader
        software, not the ebook itself. Elegant, aesthetically pleasing readers
        are not that trivial to find unfortunately, but here are three I find
        pretty and good enough, and which do read Go diagrams correctly:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/releases"
            >Thorium</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faultexception.reader&hl=en&gl=US"
            >Lithium</a
          >
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-books/">(i)Books</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Writing Go ebooks, unless as PDFs &mdash; which you can reference in
        <local-link
          link="https://psygo.github.io/fanaro.io/articles/traducao_como_jogar_go/traducao_como_jogar_go.html"
          text="this translation project"
        ></local-link>
        &mdash; eluded me for quite while, because I just had no idea how to
        create one. But, luckily, after accidentally mentioning my ignorance in
        this realm in an email to Anders Kierulf himself &mdash; founder of
        GoBooks and many other Go-related ventures and artifacts, such as the
        SGF format &mdash;, he mentioned they were simply HTML files, sometimes
        packed with CSS and JS as well, which makes total sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then another lightbulb moment came to me, and I realized they could be
        written in a very simple way using two other tools:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a></li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://gowrite.net/GOWrite2_download.html">GoWrite2</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With Pandoc, the Go writer is able to create the ebook in Markdown,
        which greatly reduces the clutter and complexity in writing; and, with
        GoWrite2, the diagrams can be created as vector images, which do not
        suffer from pixelation. Also, with slightly different editing, Pandoc is
        also able to create a PDF version of the ebook.
      </p>

      <p>
        GoBooks' EPUBs are still superior though, in my opinion. That's simply
        because their diagrams are much more interactive and suitably designed
        for EPUBs than the static vector diagrams GoWrite2 exports. However, I
        believe that isn't as big an issue if we are able to get the job done
        with as simple as stack as with Pandoc + GoWrite2<foot-note
          text="Let's hope Anders will someday release the code he uses for his 
          EPUB diagrams. We can already inspect them if we open his GoBooks' 
          EPUBS as HTML files, but, quite frankly, it's too incomprehensible to 
          me at the moment."
        ></foot-note
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, with these tools, we're all set! Check out

          text="this example"
        ></local-link>
        as reference! I've even included some reference EPUB programming books
        there if you would like to study the topic more.

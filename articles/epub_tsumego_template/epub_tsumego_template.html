      <p>
        Ever since I was able to download
        <a href="https://gobooks.com/">GoBooks'</a> EPUB books, I am in love
        with digital Go books. It's just so much more practical and speedier to
        read with them, specially due to the infinite scrolling that I wish all
        my books were EPUBs now.
      </p>

      <p>
        But note that this is different from PDF. PDFs were made to be printed,
        it's the printable document format after all, they were actually not
        made to be read on a screen. EPUBs, on the other hand, offer basically
        everything you would want when using a digital screen. Sometimes, they
        might seem ugly, but that's usually due to the reader software, not the
        ebook itself. Elegant, aesthetically pleasing readers are not that
        trivial to find unfortunately, but here are 3 I find pretty and good
        enough:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/releases"
            >Thorium</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faultexception.reader&hl=en&gl=US"
            >Lithium</a
          >
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-books/">(i)Books</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Writing Go ebooks, unless they were PDFs &mdash; which you can reference
        in
        <local-link
          link="https://fanaro.io/articles/traducao_como_jogar_go/traducao_como_jogar_go.html"
          text="this translation project"
        ></local-link>
        &mdash; eluded me for quite while, because I just had no idea how they
        were made. But, luckily, after accidentally mentioning my incompetence
        in this realm in an email to Anders Kierulf himself &mdash; founder of
        GoBooks and many other Go-related ventures &mdash; he mentioned they
        were simply HTML files, sometimes packed with CSS and JS as well, which
        makes total sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then another lightbulb moment came to me and I realized they could be
        written in a very simple way using 2 other tools:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a></li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://gowrite.net/GOWrite2_download.html">GoWrite2</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With Pandoc, the Go writer is able to create the ebook in Markdown,
        which greatly reduces the clutter when writing; and, with GoWrite2, the
        diagrams can be created as vector images, which are not affected by
        pixelation. Also, with a little bit more editing, Pandoc is also able to
        create a PDF version of the ebook.
      </p>

      <p>
        GoBooks EPUBs are still superior though, in my opinion. That's simply
        because their diagrams are much more interactive and suitably designed
        than the static vector diagrams GoWrite2 exports. However, I believe
        that isn't that big of an issue if we simply are able to get the job
        done with Pandoc + GoWrite2.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, with that, we're all set! Check out

        as reference! I included some EPUB books there if you would like to
        study the topic more.

      <h1>Standard Go Positions Evaluations with AI</h1>

      <p>
        Since KataGo is now able to evaluate board positions with points, we can
        now finally compare many positions we could only get an idea about with
        professional guess work. For example, one question I always had in mind
        was if standard Japanese handicap positions grow <em>linearly</em>, do
        they? Take a look at the tables below for more info...
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I have a pretty beefy PC setup here, but these evaluations will surely
          not be the end-all-be-all. They are bound to change, specially given
          that AI is still evolving. However, current evaluation is already
          leaps ahead what any human can offer.
        </p>

        <p>
          All in all, I believe the difference between the positions or the
          ordering will be more reliable in the long-term than their numerical
          values, of course.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll try to keep the tables below updated, if anything relevant
          happens and the evaluations change.
        </p>

      <h1>Standard Go Positions Evaluations with AI</h1>

      <p>
        Since KataGo is now able to evaluate board positions with points, we can
        now finally compare many positions we could only get an idea about with
        professional guess work. For example, one question I always had in mind
        was if standard Japanese handicap positions grow <em>linearly</em>, do
        they? Take a look at the tables below for more info...
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I have a pretty beefy PC setup here, but these evaluations will surely
          not be the end-all-be-all. They are bound to change, specially given
          that AI is still evolving. However, current evaluation is already
          leaps ahead what any human can offer.
        </p>

        <p>
          All in all, I believe the difference between the positions or the
          ordering will be more reliable in the long-term than their numerical
          values, of course.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll try to keep the tables below updated, if anything relevant
          happens and the evaluations change.
        </p>

        Note that the initial assessment in a 19x19 board is:
        <strong>W+0.2</strong> or <strong>W+51.4%</strong>, with a 6.5 komi
        under Japanese rules.

      <p>
        Now you know how many points in reverse komi each handicap is worth!
        Maybe this is ruining some bets?
      </p>

      <p>
        From the table above, we can see that growth is indeed more or less
        linear, which is suprising at least to me, since I've always thought
        that some handicap transitions were much harder than others. However,
        some jumps are larger than others. Most notably, in my opinion, is the
        jump from 3 to 4 stones, where we get more than 15 points, which is
        likely due to the fact that there are no available corners left when
        with 4 stones.

        was a big surprise to me, I remember being under the impression that
        White would have a reasonably easier position than Black, since Black's
        final tengen move seemed kind of not influencing any fight very well,
        sort of slack.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think the every player should thank the stars for tengen being only a
        1-point loss, otherwise we would see a gigantic surge in mirror Go. On
        the other hand, White's tengen, which we sometimes see when one of the
        players decides to make a statement, is considerably worse, being almost
        a 2-point loss for White. It's also worth noting that the AI tends to
        not use tengen for building moyos but rather to attack and invade more
        easily, so I believe studying with an AI would be pretty much essential
        to make it work in higher levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years ago, I played a game where I exchanged a 4-stone handicap for a
        ponnuki in the center. After the game, I felt duped<foot-note
          text="Not to mention that the stronger player thought it funny and
          lame that I ended up sacrificing the ponnuki in order to try to attack
          one of his groups. However, the AI tends to do it as well in some
          games I simulated with it."
        ></foot-note
        >, I would much rather have my 4 initial stones better distributed
        around the board. The AI seems to agree with this assessment, a 4-stone
        handicap is almost 20 points better than a ponnuki in the center.
      </p>

      <p>
        And how about a favorite triad of artificial handicap in:
        <em>empty triangle in one corner</em>; <em>side hoshi</em>; and
        <em>center of 4 hoshis</em>? I've seen many games where the stronger one
        plays one of these as an opener more or less as a statement. The
        statement is not strong at all, is it though? The
        <em>B2-Bomber in one corner</em> is a whole other story, since there way
        more pass-like moves in it, it's almost as bad as
        <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?B2BomberJosekis"
          >its article on Sensei's Library is funny</a

      <p>
        As we can see, by playing reasonable moves, it's very unlikely you're
        gonna be behind, or at least not too far behind. Nothing new there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nonetheless, there are some surprises in this last table. For instance,
        double 5-3 or 5-4 are basically the same as double 6-3 or 6-4. And
        having them parallel or alternated is essentially the same thing.

        are, as expected, bad. But that didn't stop Cho U 9p and So Yokoku 9p
        from winning against other strong pros with gargantuan holes in the
        process.

        Three other relevant mentions are
        <em>Go Seigen's Tengen + 3-3 + 4-4</em>;
        <em>Alternated Hoshis to Tengen</em>; and
        <em>4-4 + White 3-3 Direct Invasion</em>.
        <em>Go Seigen's Tengen + 3-3 + 4-4</em> is really tight in terms of
        points, a 1-point loss basically. <em>Alternated Hoshis to Tengen</em>,
        which resembles mirror Go, is also very similar to tengen itself, only a
        1-point loss &mdash; instead of tengen for the final hoshi, Black should
        invade the 3-3 in the diagonal, and the game would remain as even as it
        could be. And perhaps the only surprise is the
        <em>4-4 + White 3-3 Direct Invasion</em>, which I thought would be
        pretty much even, but is a little bit more than a 1-point loss for
        White.

        So, apparently, 6.5 is indeed the appropriate komi for the 13x13 board,
        and White gets basically the same advantage as on the 19x19 board.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tengen is again only a 1-point loss. And, again, AIs tend to use tengen
        for invading and attacking directly, not to build moyos, specially on
        the 13x13 board, where there isn't much space or time to build moyos
        anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most initial moves are valued pretty similarly to the 19x19 board, but
        the loss is generally slightly bigger.
      </p>

      <p>
        In handicap games, as expected, the winning percentages grow rapidly to
        100%, in fact, we only need a 2-stone handicap in order to get to 99%.
        Interestingly, a 9-stone handicap is not enough to get us to killing the
        whole board, probably because there are still four 3-3 invasions. Still,
        B+94 is 55% of the available 169 points, when compared to the 105/361 =
        29% in the 19x19 board.

      <p>
        I've always thought komi should be smaller than 6.5 in the 9x9 board,
        since it is so difficult to combat it as Black, it's much easier to live
        than to kill in Go after all. And I've heard stories that Japanese pros
        were of the same accord. However, it seems as though the AI thinks 6.5
        is best.
      </p>

      <p>
        For those inexperienced with the 9x9 at higher levels, it's worth noting
        that the 3-3 and the 3-4 are not enough for Black. Better play demands
        either 4-4 or tengen, but the 5-3 is also pretty sharp as well,
        according to the AI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, the winning percentage grows sharply towards 100%, only 2 stones
        is enough to almost guarantee a win. Nevertheless, to my surprise, a
        5-stone handicap is deemed as not enough to kill White wherever, I
        believe the AI thinks White can find a ko somehow. Point-wise, it's
        still a gargantuan advantage, 64/89 = 72% of the points available on the
        board.

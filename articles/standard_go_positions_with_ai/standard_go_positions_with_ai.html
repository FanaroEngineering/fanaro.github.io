      <h1>Standard Go Positions with AI Evaluations</h1>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Introduction and Context"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          Since KataGo is now able to evaluate board positions with points, not
          only winning percentages, we can now finally compare many positions
          about which we could only get an idea with professional guess work not
          too long ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, one question I always had in mind was if standard
          Japanese handicap positions grew
          <em>linearly</em>, does it? Take a look at the tables below and you'll
          get the answer...
        </p>

        <!--TODO: Include handicap positions without komi.-->
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I have a pretty beefy PC setup here, but these evaluations will
            surely not be the end-all-be-all. They are bound to change,
            specially given that AI is still evolving. However, current
            evaluation is already leaps ahead what any human is able to offer.
          </p>

          <p>
            All in all, I believe the difference between the positions or the
            ordering will be more reliable in the long-term than their numerical
            values, of course.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'll try to keep the tables below updated, if anything relevant
            happens and the evaluations change.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          For reference, all of the mentioned positions can be found in

        <p>
          Note that the initial assessment in a 19x19 board is:
          <strong>W+0.2</strong> or <strong>W+51.4%</strong>, with a 6.5 komi
          under Japanese rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          An important disclaimer is that the AI's values with and without komi
          are not necessarily the same as adding or subtracting the value of
          komi. That's because AI also takes certainty of victory or variance
          into account, i.e., a bigger lead will enable it to play safer moves,
          it doesn't care at all if the point-wise lead is big. However, I did
          run most of the positions below with and without komi to check if
          there are any notable discrepancies, and so far they seem pretty close
          &mdash; not to mention that the hierarchy and relative difference are
          more important than the numerical values. If you spot anything
          relevant, though, please let me know.

        <p>
          Now you know how many points in reverse komi each handicap is worth!
          Maybe this is ruining some bets?
        </p>

        <p>
          From the table above, we can see that growth is indeed more or less
          linear, which is suprising at least to me, since I've always thought
          that some handicap transitions were much steeper than others. Which is
          actually true, but not by that much. Most notably, in my opinion, is
          the jump from 3 to 4 stones, where we get more than 15 points, which
          is likely due to the fact that there are no available corners left
          when past 4 stones.

          was a big surprise to me, I remember being under the impression that
          White would have a reasonably easier position than Black, since
          Black's final tengen move seemed kind of not influencing any fight
          very well, sort of a slack move?
        </p>

        <p>
          I think every player should thank the stars for tengen being only a
          1-point loss, otherwise we would see a gigantic surge in Mirror
          Go<foot-note
            text="Mirror Go is still the most feasible and only likely way of
            beating the AI in even games."
          ></foot-note
          >. On the other hand, White's tengen, which we sometimes see when one
          of the players decides to make a statement, is considerably worse,
          being almost a 2-point loss for White. It's also worth noting that AI
          tends to not use tengen for building moyos but rather to attack and
          invade more easily and almost immediately, so I believe studying with
          an AI would be pretty much essential to make this sort of strategy
          work at higher levels.
        </p>

        <p>
          Years ago, I played a game where I exchanged a 4-stone handicap for a
          ponnuki in the center. After the game, I felt duped<foot-note
            text="Not to mention that the stronger player thought it funny and
          lame that I ended up sacrificing the ponnuki in order to try to attack
          one of his groups. However, the AI tends to do it as well, in some
          games I simulated with it."
          ></foot-note
          >: I would much rather have my 4 initial stones better distributed
          around the board. The AI seems to agree with this assessment, a
          4-stone handicap is almost 20 points better than a ponnuki in the
          center.
        </p>

        <p>
          And how about an infamous triad of artificial handicap in:
          <em>empty triangle in one corner</em>; <em>side hoshi</em>; and
          <em>center of 4 hoshis</em>? I've seen many games where the stronger
          player plays one of these as an opener more or less as a statement.
          The statement is not strong at all, is it though? The
          <em>B2-Bomber in one corner</em> is a whole other story, since there
          are way more pass-like moves in it, in the end it's almost as bad as

          As we can see, by playing reasonable moves, it's very unlikely you're
          gonna be behind, or at least not too far behind. Nothing new there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nonetheless, there are some surprises in this last table. For
          instance, double 5-3 or 5-4 are basically the same as double 6-3 or
          6-4. And having them parallel or alternated is essentially the same
          thing.

          Three other relevant mentions are
          <em>Go Seigen's Tengen + 3-3 + 4-4</em>;
          <em>Alternated Hoshis to Tengen</em>; and
          <em>4-4 + White 3-3 Direct Invasion</em>.
          <em>Go Seigen's Tengen + 3-3 + 4-4</em> is really tight in terms of
          points, a 1-point loss basically.
          <em>Alternated Hoshis to Tengen</em>, which resembles Mirror Go, is
          also very similar to tengen itself, only a 1-point loss &mdash;
          instead of tengen for the final hoshi, Black should invade the
          diagonal 3-3, and the game should remain as even as it could be. And
          perhaps the only surprise is the
          <em>4-4 + White 3-3 Direct Invasion</em>, which I thought would be
          pretty much even, but is a little bit more than a 1-point loss for
          White.

          So, apparently, 6.5 is indeed the appropriate komi for the 13x13
          board, and White gets basically the same advantage as on the 19x19
          board.
        </p>

        <p>
          This time, handicap does not progress linearly at all, with some jumps
          being near double others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tengen is again only a 1-point loss. And, again, AIs tend to use
          tengen for invading and attacking directly, not to build moyos,
          specially on the 13x13 board, where there isn't much space or time to
          build moyos anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most initial moves are valued pretty similarly to the 19x19 board, but
          the loss is generally slightly bigger.
        </p>

        <p>
          In handicap games, as expected, the winning percentages grow rapidly
          to 100%, in fact, we only need a 2-stone handicap in order to get to
          99%. Interestingly, a 9-stone handicap is not enough to get us to
          killing the whole board, probably because there are still four 3-3
          invasions. Still, B+94 is 55% of the available 169 points, when
          compared to the 105/361 = 29% in the 19x19 board's 9-stone handicap.

        <p>
          I've always thought komi should be smaller than 6.5 in the 9x9 board,
          since it is so difficult to combat it as Black, it's much easier to
          live than to kill in Go after all. And I've heard stories that
          Japanese pros were of the same accord. However, it seems as though AI
          thinks 6.5 is best.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly to the 13x13 board, handicap again does not progress
          linearly at all. It seems more and more likely that the 19x19 board is
          a special size, or perhaps an inflection point for linearity? From
          some brief attempts with other board sizes, the 13x13 is actually
          closer to the inflection point of linearity, in my opinion. For
          example, the 15x15<foot-note
            text="I'm a huge advocate of 15x15 instead of 13x13. I think it's 
            much richer in strategies in comparison to the 13x13, and it's much 
            less time-consuming than the 19x19 board."
          ></foot-note>
          board seems to be close to linear already, with respect to Japanese
          handicap.
        </p>

        <p>
          For those inexperienced with the 9x9 at higher levels, it's worth
          noting that the 3-3 and the 3-4 are not enough for Black. Better play
          demands either 4-4 or tengen, but the 5-3 is also pretty sharp as
          well, according to AI.
        </p>

        <p>
          Again, the winning percentage grows sharply towards 100% in handicap
          games, only 2 stones is enough to nearly guarantee a win.
          Nevertheless, to my surprise, a 5-stone handicap is deemed as not
          enough to kill White wherever. I believe the AI thinks White can find
          a ko somehow. Point-wise, it's still a humongous advantage, 64/89 =
          72% of the points initially available on the board.

          The table is below is just a little bit beyond a curiosity, not much
          more. It's nice to see all the numbers side to side, though.
        </p>

        <p>
          The term <em>% of initial points on the board</em> is basically the
          estimated score by the AI divided by the "size" of the board which
          are, for the 9x9, 13x13, and 19x19 respectively: 81, 169, and 361.
